1hro3au,m54jlcu,"Few things that I have learnt after starting a business.
(Since I saw many wanting to get into this)
1. It‚Äôs a long game, takes time to build a successful business. 
2. If you start a side business, it stays that way. Have the intention of doing it big. Have a big vision also check the TAM(Total Addressable Market)of your product.
3. Business starts building when the customer does the 2nd transaction.
4. Don‚Äôt quit your 9 to 5 job, immediately as soon as you see success. Business will have its ups and downs. Only when you have enough capital to survive for a year without sales, you can quit then.
5. Choose your friends carefully, and you need not share it with your friends and family when you start a business. Generally in India, majority of the parents don‚Äôt teach their kids to take risk. It‚Äôs frowned upon and they always wish for you to play it safe.
6. Be honest and sincere with your customers. Accept if it‚Äôs your mistake.
7. Influencer marketing doesn‚Äôt always bring in sales. The views, likes, shares, saves etc doesn‚Äôt mean anything.
8. It‚Äôs mandatory to spend on two things. Product and Marketing. You need to get both the things right to have successful business.
9. It‚Äôs not easy, it‚Äôs not for everyone. It messes with your head. You need to work more than 12 hours per day at-least.  There will be days when you feel why did you even start it. You ll get lot of rude customers, who feel entitled to yell at you for things that you are not even responsible for.",6,1735875169

What are their expectations? What makes them tick? What are their pet peeves? How would they like their vendors and Partners to run their business? CDC is the result of decades of man-hours of putting all this into action.

How? We are a Design Company that speaks to Founders‚Äô needs and headaches like nobody else. Our business model is super-niche. Our design philosophy is honed to a fine point. We are literally, the painkiller that Founders need.

The result? Founders we work with say we ‚Äòget it‚Äô when they talk about their problems. We deliver solutions that cut through the clutter. We deliver on our promises without having to be followed up on. We go over and above what is expected of us. Founders know that when they talk to CDC, their problems will get solved quickly and with a sense of partnership that‚Äôs authentic.

What do we do? We help Founders get their business out in the open and then help them hunt for their customers and Venture Capital money.

I‚Äôve been in the markets for 7+ years. I‚Äôve seen enough to understand that more than courses or apps, people need someone that they can rely on.

I‚Äôm upfront about how I go about things: I understand your financial requirements, and we come up with a plan to make things happen. I get a tiny commission from the mutual fund companies for what you invest through me. No fees. And I do it not for the money, but to earn your trust. At the end of the day, your trust is my reputation, isn‚Äôt it? 

And if you wonder why me and not your other options in the market: Finfluencers make money out of content that they feed you. Direct mutual funds are good if you have the time to DIY. Your bank only cares about its targets. And if you have a friend/contact who helps you invest in shares, you better be ready for the kind of disaster it could be.

Driving/Riding is stressful and not a day goes by without experiencing some kind of road rage and increased BP with the absolute lack of lane discipline and civic sense. We can't change people's behaviour so I stopped driving regularly instead and do these now for a peaceful commute. 

First and foremost try and leave early assuming there will be traffic. Use public transport wherever possible (Metro, AC bus, BMTC in that order) next cabs and Auto (I use multiple aggregators Namma yatri, Rapido, Ola, Uber and await confirmation and once I see the closest vehicle has started to move i cancel the rest) there can be some walking involved in some of these instances. 

But whenever I chose to drive/ride - assume there will be retards on the road, avoid engaging in any confrontation especially with women or autowala's whosever mistake whenever possible just leave.

1mhb83b,n77zmon,"Look, Imma use some hard facts to extrapolate the Blue Line's opening date, using the opening dates of the other lines, including the yellow Line, since it opening on the 10^(th) seems essentially certain now.

1. The Purple Line- The work on Phase 1 started on the 15^(th) of April, 2007, and it was fully completed on the 30^(th) of April, 2016. 9 years, 15 days after, and around 4 years after the deadline.  In October of the same year, work on Phase 2, the extension to Challaghatta, started, and the one to Whitefield started after May 2017 (for simplicity's sake I will call the Whitefield one 1A and the Challaghatta one 2A). 2A was completed fully on the 9^(th) of October, 2023, and 1A on the same day. 7 years for 2B, and 6 years, 5 months for 1A.
2. Green Line- Construction for Phase 1 (the elevated section from Peenya Industry to Sampige Road) started around 2009(*), the National College to Yelachenahalli extension (which I shall call Phase 1B), started in 2010(*), and Phase 1A (the underground section) in May 2011. Phase 1 opened completely on the 1^(st)¬†of May, 2015, around 6 years after construction started, and both Phase 1A and 1B on the 18^(th)¬†of June, 2017, so 7 years for 1B and 6 years, one month, for 1A. In Phase 2, the Silk Institute extension started work on October 2016, and opened on the 14^(th)¬†of January, 2021, so around 4 years and around 3 months after construction started, and the Madavara extension on June 2017, and was completed on the 7^(th)¬†of November, 2024, so 7 years and around 5 months (The Fuck, Simplex Infrastructure Ltd., The Fuck).
3. Yellow Line-The Foundation was laid down on the 14^(th) of June 2016, but actual construction started in November 2017. It will be finished on the 10^(th) of August, 2025, so 7 years and around 10 months after construction started, and almost 3 years of delays.

From this, I can say that the average is around 7 years from the start of construction to the end, and that is inflated by the Madavara extension and all the Underground work, which has definitely inflated the average, and is essentially removable for any questions regarding the Blue Line. Let us add 2 years to that, for no reason bar making it be tied to the good ol' Purple Line for the largest delay and as a safety measure. That means the Silk Board-K R Pura stretch shall open by *2030,* and the full line by early *2031.* 4 entire years before your preposterous claim that would have been laughed out if not for the deplorable state of this here subreddit, where I would not be surprised if someone honestly believes that the year 2077 will happen before the whole ORR circle is completed.",2,1754483927

The day people from north eastern India start driving autos, these local goons will die of starvation (and I wholeheartedly wish that upon them). I was born in Bangalore but lived in Bombay till 2008, and the auto drivers there were so good they didn't even ask you any questions before you get in. You could sit down, tell them where you wanted to go, and they'd take you there, no questions asked. They would even return change, even if it was as less as 1 rupee unlike these Bangalore drivers who pocket any sum of money they can citing they don't have change or some bullshit excuse for their greed. I used to come down to Bangalore for my summer vacation every year before we moved back, and even as early as 20 years ago this auto driver attitude of being a greedy motherfucker was as prevalent as it is today - it's not even new arguments it's the same old ""khaali barbeku, traffic, male banthu etc."" 

I remember when PVR forum (what's now called Nexus) in Koramangala was the only multiplex around, and auto drivers would line up outside the mall quoting ridiculous prices for pretty much anywhere stating the usual nonsense excuses. They even had a prepaid auto stand, but those rates were already inflated so no real difference. When ride sharing apps became so successful because these greedy pieces of shit didn't want to actually transport anyone, they protested then too, fighting for a livelihood they didn't want to earn, at least not fairly. The only reason they still exist is because driving autos is their side business. Their main business is being muscle for politicians along with a sizeable vote bank. The sad part is even if an auto driver tries to operate fairly based on the meter, the other bad fish bully and harass him into becoming like the rest of them.

# Illegal Encroachment of BBMP Public Road in Indiranagar



Two apartment associations in Indiranagar have¬†*completely encroached upon a BBMP-owned public road*. This is a dead-end road that connects only to two apartment buildings and a church, but it is officially public property‚ÄîBBMP has installed a road sign at the entrance and even recently completed white-topping work here.

Until recently, residents from nearby areas (not just from these apartments) regularly used this road for walking‚Äîespecially dog walking‚Äîand the open space was often used by taxis and autos to park¬†*without obstructing traffic*.

Shockingly, after BBMP improved the road, the two apartment associations¬†*illegally installed a gate*¬†across the entire road and put up a board that says:  
**‚ÄúAccess Restricted to Residents & Guests of \[Apartment Names\] and Church Visitors Only.‚Äù**

This is blatant misuse and illegal restriction of a¬†*public road maintained by BBMP*.  
Such a move limits access to common citizens and sets a dangerous precedent of privatizing public infrastructure for private benefit.

I‚Äôm unsure how to escalate this legally, but I‚Äôm hoping this reaches:

* **Civic activists**
* **Urban planning NGOs**
* **Journalists/media who report on urban issues**
* **Concerned citizens and authorities in Bangalore**

If anyone is able to take this up, raise awareness, or direct this to the right people within BBMP or BMTF, please do. I'm happy to share more details and photos if needed.

I know its easier said than done, but we need go full in and get a formal FIR filed in auto harassment cases specially towards women(as women have more rights) and take the case up till end in the courts and force the government to cancel their license and seize their vehicles.

Once number of FIRs against auto drivers rise we can take help of media and opposition MPs to highlight this issue through national media. Opposition MPs will make sure to turn this issue political and national media will defame the current government for its inability to punish criminals.
