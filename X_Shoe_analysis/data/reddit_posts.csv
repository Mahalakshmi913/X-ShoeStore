1lpsiyk,bangalore,Done with this city - run by goons called rickshawalas,"What started as regular Wednesday quickly spiraled into one of the most frustrating mornings in bangalore. 

The incident :   
A few years ago when i moved to bangalore, i remember being stranded on road after office on ORR - in rain unable to find any cab, rick or lift till home. Unlike mumbai or kolkata where you can call a taxi on the go, the public transport here makes you feel like you are held hostage to airport level fares for 8-10km rides. That frustration led me to buy a bike - so that i dont have to beg always to poorly available public transport

To today :   
I was riding to office on road along ORR which since the ban of bike taxis has been jampacked in morning hours. Like any other bike, i was following a lane which was getting shorter for 3 vehicles to pass (2 cars and a bike).   
I realised there's a cab coming from the opp lane and i was in middle of road. The bike ahead of me could move between 2 cars beside us but i had no space. In order to give space for the cab, i moved my bike on opp side of my lane standing on what you can call footpath (encroacheed by societies walkway actually)   
After the cab smoothly had passed along the rickshaw which was behind the cab (which obviously had more space than a car) started abusing me for reason i dont know. I can only assume it was due to lane change on wrong side.   
He accelarated his rick towards me as if he is gonna dash me and then dared to punch me from his seat. And then drove away. Thanks to my helmet i didnt get hurt.   
But i was shocked with the audacity of these rickshawalas on hitting random people on road. On the same road last week i saw a fallen scooty and a guy fighting rickshawala who is holding a metal rod and abusing the guy who apparently fell from scooty in what can seem like being hit by rickshaw. The worse part is, later i saw the guy driving away with lady behind him. No other city I lived in treated people in such way. 

I have lived across 4 cities in india - student or a working professional. And sure, people fight with rickshawala or bus guy or in public. But i have never seen gundaraj by public transport people over common folks. Never have i ever felt any city so uncultured and unbothered with their behaviour. 

And for people who are going to tell me : why i came to this city? or just leave or learn kannada ?   
trust me : This might be last straw. I am very much on same page with you guys on leaving this city.   
I came here for my career but I am realising where i live is more important to me than my career. The only reason this city was growing due to organisations encashing on the tax benefits and talent pool. But I feel and now hope that runs out soon. 

TL;DR: Got assaulted by a rickshaw driver while riding to work. Not the first time I’ve seen such aggression on Bangalore roads. Fed up with the lawlessness, lack of accountability, and daily chaos.",668,84,1751452807,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1lpsiyk/done_with_this_city_run_by_goons_called/

1mlm7xl,bangalore,Daylight Ice Cream Scam Running in Cubbon Park,"I wanted to bring attention to a scam happening right inside Cubbon Park.

Ice cream sellers in stalls/carts are blatantly overcharging visitors. They sell ice creams that have an MRP of ₹25 for ₹60. The trick? They deliberately remove the wrapper or erase MRP before handing the ice cream to you, so you can’t verify the actual price.

If you question them, they casually say “this is the price here” and move on. Most people don’t argue because it’s just a few extra rupees, but in reality, this is straight-up fraud. And it’s happening in broad daylight in a public park.

I’m sharing this so visitors can be aware and not fall for it. Always ask for the wrapper or check the MRP before buying — or better, avoid buying from such sellers entirely.

This isn’t just about the extra money, it’s about vendors exploiting public spaces and cheating unsuspecting customers, including children.

Stay alert, and spread the word.",379,47,1754735457,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1mlm7xl/daylight_ice_cream_scam_running_in_cubbon_park/

The auto driver threatens Rapido drivers that there is some rules from court, two wheeler hiring is not allowed. Then same is also applicable for autodrivers, as per law they should charge only according to meter, nothing extra. Make that first  without meter we would not take auto.
As citizens we should ask every auto driver that they should agree to run only on meter in Bangalore else they should not create trouble for Rapido drivers.

Recently in the thanisandra main road a child died due to reckless drunk driving by a BBMP waste collection truck driver(I witnessed the man not being in a sane state of mind, either he was drunk or was under the influence of something else). My society had requested the MLA of our constituency for a speed breaker to avoid such accidents as 2 people died in January, but he just puts the blame on us and was like we should drive safely it's an airport road. My question is if it's an airport road why isn't the road planned properly to avoid accidents, it's not even planned properly with various intersecting junctions. Speed breakers and foot over bridges are the bare minimum, it's high time BBMP gets elected representatives to ensure accountability.",222,7,1743496500,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/10-year-old-boy-dies-after-being-run-over-by-speeding-garbage-truck-in-bengaluru-cops-8040416

I didn't entertain her for some time because i could hear a girl standing behind me telling her friend in kannada that she always does this and all so early in the morning i didnt want to fight. But at one point she started asking me for money, she was not even polite straight up dhamki she was giving saying ""when you dont have cash why do you take service dont you feel ashamed "". I asked her service of what and she went ""idk"". I am not somone who fights the moment she started using slur calling me randi and stuff i started shaking and probably girls around could see me shivering and they stepped in and took a stand for me and made her shut up and asked me if I was okay and not to take this to the heart.

1ff1fq0,bangalore,Open rape threats,"Was driving along Kathriguppe road today. An auto zoomed in from the left to the extreme right and almost crashed into 2 cars, causing a pileup. All I could do was honk, and then pass by it. The driver in the auto kept quiet because he knew he was driving like a maniac. But there was a young man in the auto who walked up to me when the signal turned red. He cursed me, my mother, and my entire family out. In beautiful, colourful language. He called us both prostitutes, explained in detail about all the positions we would have intercourse with men in, and then showed me how he would give me oral pleasure (with his tongue between his fingers). He was probably all of 21 or 22, and he got angry because of 2 people honking at the auto that he was in. He tried breaking my window, and prying open my door. With 30 others watching him. He seemed to have assumed that I didn’t know the language, so his insults got even more colourful until the signal turned green, and he said that he would kill me and my entire family after raping us if the video I recorded of his misbehaviour ever got out. He was in an auto numbered KA05AC4811, and some netizens were kind enough to help me with the auto’s RC details. 

This is the state of some people here, who seem to run around with no consequences whatsoever. 

When we say “Namma Bengaluru”, we should feel safe, and confident saying “Namma”. What is happening here? 


Edit - a lot of comments have told me to post it on twitter. I already did, and haven’t received any response yet. For anyone willing to understand my perspective and help, here is the thread - https://x.com/satanicthots/status/1834093045723127813?s=46&t=bgZRNTn0H5lpcyP3Dd36Vg




Edit - I don’t think people understand, so here goes - I’m from Bangalore. I speak Kannada. I have been driving for decades. I have sent the police the required footage. I’ve left town because I’m that disturbed that it happened right beside my house, and I feel unsafe that even the police is calling me without any context at all at 9 pm to come to the police station. 

If you can help, do. If you can’t, kindly stay away. It’s the nicest way I can ask you to not spread “woke” nonsense on this post. It’s about safety. Nothing else. It’s about inciting violence for no good reason. 

Thank you all who supported this. And for those who are playing “devil’s advocate”, yoU iS clEaRly OuT oF yOuR mInD, MagaAS. YoU nEEd yOuR faMily Ladies ThReatenEd or WhaT, Da? 😕

Further updates - the police called me 2 days ago at 9 pm to come and file a case but there were voices in the background that said “ask her to come now, we will deal with it”, so I declined and told them I’m leaving town. They haven’t gotten back after that. At all. 

Edit - the boy has not been caught. All the BLR police needed to do was check categorically with the driver about where he dropped him off. There’s no way the driver wouldn’t have remembered, considering the adventure he was put through. But sigh. Efficiency doesn’t seem to be their thing, neither is women’s safety. Wonder if we will actually get a force that’ll protect us one day. :) ",1610,296,1726144408,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1ff1fq0/open_rape_threats/
1f9p65r,bangalore,Harassment by Auto driver with my wife. ,"I thought I will share me and my wife’s experience with you guys, which has been a very, very similar to what’s floating in the news.

Few days back my wife with her friend took an auto from Whitefield to Bannerughatta Road around 9:30pm from Uber.

The auto driver after boarding them started asking for them to pay through UPI/Cash. The payment was already selected default as Uber Money. They kept trying throughout their ride but couldn’t change. Uber doesn’t allow payment method change to cash. 

She dropped her friend at her stop and reached our apartment gate and informed that payment was done through Uber Money and they couldn’t change it to cash. 

Once she started moving towards gate the auto driver just grabbed her hand and started arguing that money hasn’t reached him and so on. She kept explaining the payment is done and she even showed the screenshot that payment has been made.

The auto driver got very angry and snatched her phone, she shouted and called the guards. The guards couldn’t control him as he was like he will hurt them even.

After all the noise apartment folks came down and started trying to calm the auto driver down but he wouldn’t listen. The whole time my wife couldn’t call me or anyone for help. Fortunate that apartment folks came for help. 

The police was called and when the police arrived even then he wouldn’t give her phone back. The police were taking the auto driver side the whole time. If somehow it was my wife’s fault. Then one of the resident called me and I went running. When I went this was like around 30 mins into the issue he returned the phone to us. 

After a while senior police officers arrived. Police did listen to both parties and said what you want to do and suggested that let him say sorry and let him go. He kept arguing that he was right and kept lying that he hadn’t touched her at all.

We kept our stance and we took the guy to the station and raised an FIR against him. He kept the same argument that he didn’t do anything wrong. After realising that this is leading to his arrest he started saying sorry and all.

All this went till 2am in the morning. 

We complained and he was kept throughout the night in the station.

I took a picture of a Tata nano -KA05MS6127 to submit on the traffic app for violation for coming in the wrong side near DG petrol bunk.

The person then stopped the vehicle turned around and chased to run me over for 1 km. I ran to escape from him and to save my life. His wife was also in the car and both of them were yelling abuses at me. Finally they caught up to me and rammed me against a wall and threatened to kill me if I don’t delete the picture. I however sent the picture to a friend before they caught up to me. In order to deescalate the situation I removed the picture in front of the husband and wife from my phone. 

Now I’m at the BSK Police station hoping some form of action can be taken against such rowdy behaviour in our city.


Resolution:
The ""corporate"" person who behaved like a rowdy, was called to the police station and was asked to give a written statement apologising for his cheap actions, and also apologised to me profusely. Also, he got an earful from the people present.
I decided to leave it at that because some people are just not worth my time, and I'm in no control over how some idiots behave in our city.

So now I’m curious 
👉 If you’ve moved out of blr (to another Indian city or abroad), what’s the one thing you still miss the most? Is it: 

•	That unbeatable weather? 

•	The idli-dosa-chai magic from all the buzzing  joints? 

•	The weekend pub hopping at Indiranagar/Brigade/ Koramangala? 

•	Or just the mad chaos that somehow makes life interesting?

1go2c98,bangalore,Zepto but for Garbage Collection,"Hey everyone,

I'm exploring a startup idea specifically targeting the garbage collection mess in Indian cities (initially Bangalore). Here's the concept:

Problem:
- Unreliable government garbage collection
- Apartment complexes struggling with waste management
- No professional/tech-enabled solution
- Growing urban waste crisis

Solution: An app-based garbage collection service

Key Features:
- Schedule pickups through app
- Real-time tracking
- Professional waste collectors
- Proper segregation and disposal
- Monthly subscription model
- Both residential & commercial services

Target Market:
- Apartment complexes
- Gated communities
- Commercial spaces
- Individual homes in areas with poor collection

Revenue Model:
- Monthly subscriptions (₹299-499)
- Premium services
- Commercial contracts
- Recycling partnerships

Questions for r/Bangalore:
1. Would people pay for reliable garbage collection?
2. Any major operational challenges I'm missing?
3. How to handle local body permissions/regulations?
4. Anyone here from Bangalore who can share insights about waste management pain points?
5. Thoughts on scalability to other cities?

Looking for honest feedback, especially from people who've run operations-heavy startups or those familiar with waste management space.

i don't understand, i expected this kind of stuff didn't happen around educated people but apparently not. all 3 times i was minding my own business and not even making eye contact. idk how normal this is but it's quite uncomfortable 

my roommate has also experienced something similar where a guy kept offering to accompany her back to her place and was trying to get info on where she lived. it's starting to feel like men normally behave like this here

is this normal? ladies?

also if you're a man reading this who behaves like this please stop. it's not funny or cool

I along with 7 other pending delivery partners were in the back area where we could see the entire kitchen clearly

We saw them cooking tons of chicken in black oil which clearly looks like motor oil which hasnt been changed in days
Which was some extent fine
Until an worker dropped rougly half a kg chicken by accident onto the floor covered in shoe stains (wet floor, mopped probably)

Myself standing from the pickup point jokingly said in a loud voice to him and the other partners 

In hindi and kannada mix

 ""dekh lo bhaiyo, hamare jaane ke baad yahi daal denge wapas, adhike swaasthaagi iralla, idhella tinkond yenn yenn rohga aagthide""

And all the delivery boys laughed at him in a mocking tone 
And he turned around and said 
""aamele hakaalaa ivaage haaktivi (not later now only)"" 
And he picked up those chicken
And dropped it in 
All of us turned quite seeing this particular incident 

I as a human regardless of my profession 
Decided to say this to my customer about the cons of these foods and about the incident

All id say you guys, is please avoid such high scale food chains
Many of my friends in subway, Burger king have told me several instances where such unhygienic acts are being done",1118,85,1752753975,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1m25rz8/i_couldnt_hold_this_in_anymore/
1h72wtj,bangalore,Seeking Support and Guidance for a Hit-and-Run Case,"Hello everyone,

I’m Loganathan, and I was involved in a serious hit-and-run accident on 27th November 2024 at 8:12 PM near ASC Center Signal. I was riding my bike (TN42AP0499) when a black Pajero SUV, coming from Domlur Road towards Trinity Signal, hit my bike’s front wheel and fled the scene. I suffered a severe leg fracture, underwent major surgery involving plates and nails, and spent over ₹4.5 lakh on medical expenses. The doctors have advised six months of rest, and as the sole breadwinner for my family, this has left us in a financial and emotional crisis.

From the day of the accident, my family and I tried filing a complaint at the Ulsoor Police Station, but the police initially refused, stating that the car number was unavailable. On 1st December, after 7 PM, the police unexpectedly came to my house, took my complaint, and filed the FIR on the same day. However, I strongly suspect there is a deliberate delay or possible concealment of details. It feels like the police might already know the car’s registration number but are withholding it.

Unfortunately, I don’t have the hit-and-run car’s registration number. Is there any way to push the police to take more action or to escalate the matter to higher authorities? I believe the car’s details could be identified through surveillance cameras or other means, but I’m unsure how to proceed.

I am seeking advice and support:
	•	Has anyone faced a similar situation or know how to deal with such cases?
	•	How can I ensure the police take this investigation seriously and reveal the car’s details?

This accident has disrupted my life, and my family is struggling to recover from its effects. Any guidance or support you can offer would mean a lot to me.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story.",45,17,1733380186,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1h72wtj/seeking_support_and_guidance_for_a_hitandrun_case/

I came across this man and when he saw me, he did this lewd gesture of blowing a kiss to me. Now my first reaction was disgust which I expressed. I then tried to run after him to beat him but I am 32 weeks pregnant and thought I should care about my safety rather than engage with this lunatic.. Once he saw my reaction, he increased his pace of walking and then I again tried to shout and run after him and he ran away. It then immediately struck me to call my husband to get his car out asap so that we can chase him as I want him to think twice before he did that to someone else.. A few mins into the drive I spotted him on a busy main road. When he saw me he started saying sorry and was constantly crossing the road and back.

1lxxb7e,bangalore,"Fortis – Worst Hospital Experience, and Honestly Feels Like All Bangalore Hospitals Are the Same Now","Posting this after wasting two full days at Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road — and honestly, I’m beyond frustrated. What’s shocking is that this seems to be the new normal in Bangalore’s so-called “premium” hospitals.

So here’s what happened:

We had a 9:30 AM appointment with a senior doctor. Reached on time, registered, and waited. And waited. And waited some more. The doctor finally showed up around 1 PM. That’s nearly 3.5 hours of sitting pointlessly in the waiting area. No update, no accountability, nothing. Apparently, this happens all the time — the doctor is either on rounds or just late. So what’s the point of giving fixed appointments?

Then comes the list of tests the doctor prescribed — and honestly, this part made me feel like I was being scammed in broad daylight. A basic sonography was quoted at ₹3200 inside the hospital. I checked outside — same test is ₹1200 at any good diagnostic center nearby. Why the massive markup? What magical machine are they using?

But it doesn’t stop there. The billing desk didn’t even include all the tests the doctor wrote. The technician didn’t bother to verify. So obviously when we returned, the doctor asked, “Where are these reports?” And we had no answer. Because their own staff never processed them. That’s not just expensive — it’s completely disorganized.

After all this, guess what? They ask us to come again on Monday. After spending over 6 hours across two days already. Seriously?? Do they think we have no jobs, no life, nothing better to do?

It genuinely feels like places like Fortis Bannerghatta are running a well-oiled billing machine disguised as a hospital. The human touch, the empathy, even basic organization — it’s all missing. And sadly, this seems to be the story at many so-called top hospitals in Bangalore — Manipal, Sakra, Apollo... friends have shared similar experiences. Either the doctors are always late, or you're forced into a maze of overpriced diagnostics and roundabout visits.

And here’s what’s worse — they act like everyone living in Bangalore makes ₹1 crore a month and won’t question prices. But hello, we’re normal people! We work hard, we budget, and we expect basic value and respect when we go to a hospital.


---



Fortis Bannerghatta appointment at 9:30 AM → doctor came at 1 PM.

Tests grossly overpriced (₹3200 sonography that’s ₹1200 outside).

Billing and testing staff don’t coordinate at all.

Wasted 2 full days and now being asked to come again.

No empathy, just pure commercial mindset.



---

If you're considering Fortis Bannerghatta or any big private hospital in Bangalore — be ready to pay a lot, wait endlessly, and repeat visits. Honestly, healthcare here has become less about care and more about business.

Let me know if others have faced the same. Would love to know if there’s any hospital in Bangalore that still values patients over profits.

Edit: One more deeply concerning observation — at Fortis Bannerghatta, the mortuary is situated directly opposite the kitchen storage area. This is not only shocking from a basic hospital planning and hygiene perspective, but also raises serious questions about sanitation standards and regulatory oversight. In any institution claiming to offer quality healthcare, such an arrangement is simply unacceptable. It reflects a complete disregard for both emotional sensitivity and public health norms.",339,153,1752316443,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1lxxb7e/fortis_worst_hospital_experience_and_honestly/

1jmgxh6,bangalore,"Tears of rage, frustration, and helplessness","
(Throwaway account. I apologise for any mistakes. I also apologise for the long rant. Just want to vent. Hands shaking while writing this) 

I come from a long line of farmers. My great grandparents were farmers. My grandparents were farmers. And my father is now a farmer. He saved what he could in life not to invest in commercial land / real estate in the city, but in agricultural land in his village so that he could continue what his forebears did for centuries. 

It was and always has been my wish to join my father and become a farmer. I hate the corporate life. But why should I become a farmer? Why should other youngsters like me in India go into agriculture? It breaks my heart to say it but it’s true. 

My father spent all day and night yesterday trying to sell a lorry load of paddy to buyers. Not for profit but at the bare minimum of the cost price. None of the farmers were even asking for a profit. And all the buyers bully the farmers to sell it at a loss. And where can the farmers go now? They’ve brought this lorry load from 450 km away. They can’t turn the lorry back and they can’t wait there for 4 days since it’s festival and the buyers go for their holidays. What can they do? He and the others sold it at a loss. He called back home in tears. Broke my family’s hearts. My heart. 

It was months of work growing the crops. So much care. So much hard work. When we buy a kilo of rice from the store / get it delivered on an app, we don’t understand the incredible hard work the farmers go through. They run to the fields each night if the motors don’t work. No electricity. Sweltering heat during the day. I have seen their legs rip open and bleed because of the fields and they pay it no mind. They bear the pain of the bloody gashes on their legs for days because they can’t leave the fields during those crucial days. Men and women. They have to pray for rains to either come or go depending on what the crops need. And they put their blood, sweat, and tears into growing the crops that all of us need to survive. And all for what? To be bullied because we can’t afford huge warehouses to hoard our grain like the big players. We’re not wealthy enough own mills to process them ourselves and sell it at a 10X markup. We have to sell them before the rains start otherwise it’s all ruined. So people play with our helplessness. 

I’m so angry and frustrated and helpless for my father and the other farmers that went with him. Most of the village is gonna be at a loss even after growing thousands of kilos of paddy. I will be able to send money back home because of my job. But what about the other farmers who went with with my father? What will they do for money? Some are so poor that they will rely on rations from the government to feed their families. I know such families. 

I’m educated enough to know Reddit and vent my helplessness and frustration out here. Where can they go? 

They’re gonna go back home to their families today and tell them that couldn’t get any profit home even though they are feeding their fellow Indians. 

Please spare a prayer for all us farmers the next time you eat your biryani or your Thai green curry. Know that we couldn’t even make a rupee off of growing the rice that you’re eating. 

And please, please, please, don’t waste food. Only farmers know the pain of growing it. 

I apologise if I’ve offended anyone reading by something I’ve said. Please correct me if I’m wrong about something. 

TLDR - Demotivated to be a farmer in India. Father and other farmers sold their grain at loss. 



Edit - Want to thank the community for the responses. I found value in each one. I wrote the post when I was irrational and upset. As I continued to read the comments, I was moved by the number of people who jumped into problem solving instead of just telling me to grow up. I do have a lot of growing up to do. I also have to do a lot of research and figure this out. If there is anyone who might want to collaborate or share advice / wisdom, pls do reach out. I want to learn from those who have figured it out. That will help me determine if those solutions suit my village’s needs.

I just tried booking an auto from JP Nagar to Jayanagar—bare minimum 3 km, meter should be ₹60–70. Even if they cut us some slack and take ₹80, fine. But Uber, Ola, Rapido, Namma Yatri are all quoting ₹160 minimum?! 😡

And the moment you cancel and try again? It’s ₹160 from every driver. Like, where’s the cartel, maga? Auto mafia in full swing!

If you try to hail on the street, they’ll size you up—“Jayanagar, appa? ₹180.” Bruh, how? Missed my balloon money?

I get fuel prices have shot up, inflation is real, but this is straight-up daylight robbery. We Bengaluru folks—tech city, startup hub—still rely on autos for last-mile relief. Instead, they’ve become mini-luxury taxis with zero mercy.

BMTC is packed, Metro expansion is crawling, and these autos are our only backup. But ₹160 for 3 km? I could walk faster and save my dignity.

Namma Bengaluru fam, who’s endorsing this? We’re all silent spectators, paying ₹160. Time to voice up! Stop the cancel-app-repeat cycle. Before we have to start running from JP Nagar to Jayanagar (at least free cardio 😂).

1n24n2b,bangalore,Bangalore needs a delicensing drive !! Like demonetisation for licences. Hear me out.,"Reaching the destination has started looking like a side-quest these days. Driving has become less about the skill and more about mentally and physically surviving chaos !! 

You can tell these peeps have Bought their licences!! The traffic rules have become something elective rather than mandatory. Indicators? Luxury. Lane discipline? Mythical. Honking? The traffic Anthem!!

Here's my ranty solution:  License Purge !

- Cancel licenses in phases. No exemptions. Everyone has to retest

- A stricter test. Not ""drive 10 metres straight and bribe the inspector"".

-  I'm talking parallel parking, uphill starts, merging lanes, signal awareness, law awareness, sign awareness, driving in the rain/night and navigating peak hour without loosing your soul !!!

- It isn't unrealistic.. get fucking simulators if necessary !!! We're paying the highest road and transport tax in the country after all !!

- A transparent AI- assisted process.

- Tiered licenses ( eg., learner> Provisional > Full licence) with point system ( the point system is already in discussion I guess)

- Pass ? You deserve to be on the road. 
- Fail ? Use the public transport until you pass
- subsidized driving schools, free refresher courses.

Yes, it would create short-term disruptions. But in the long run, it would lead to better driver's, fewer accidents, smoother traffic and safer streets. We definitely need infrastructures but, we also need responsible driver's behind the wheel. 

TL;DR: Bangalore needs a License Reset. Cancel all current licences, re-test under strict, transparent rules, and build a driving culture rooted in skill and responsibility. Infrastructure won’t save us if drivers aren’t competent.",452,85,1756361763,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1n24n2b/bangalore_needs_a_delicensing_drive_like/

1mcbbz6,bangalore,Catena homes scam,"
CATENA HOMES FRAUD — DO NOT FALL FOR IT!

My mother-in-law got trapped in a housing scam run by Catena Homes, and we’re still fighting to get her full money back. She had leased a 3BHK flat through them for ₹25 lakhs. Everything seemed smooth in the beginning. But once the lease period ended and it was time for the refund, the nightmare began.

They refunded a partial amount, dragging the process for weeks with excuses and silence.

We finally received partial refund after reaching out to company owner involving police officials and legal threatening.
 Now, ₹2 lakhs is still pending, and they’ve completely stopped responding. No calls, no emails, no messages, just complete radio silence. We got the lease amount refunded only after involving cops with influence.

But here’s the worst part:
We found out dozens of others are going through the same hell. Many tenants who leased through Catena are still living in those flats, but their lease money is gone and the actual property owners are now threatening eviction. Why? Because Catena didn’t pay the owners either.

So now, innocent tenants some of whom paid ₹10–25 lakhs as lease money are being treated like squatters while Catena has vanished.

They’ve changed their office address, deleted their online presence, no Google business page as people started asking them to respond and completely ghosted their customers. No support, no accountability, and definitely no sign of that missing money.

If you're dealing with Catena Homes — GET OUT NOW.
If you're considering leasing through them — DON’T.
If you’ve already been scammed — connect with others and take legal action. Strength in numbers.

This is not just one family’s loss — it’s a coordinated scam that’s hurt dozens of families. Catena Homes must be held accountable.

1go0aex,bangalore,Another BLR scam?,"One of my friends introduced me to their partner today (they are running some kind of business). The reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners.

They set up a meeting at Chaayos, Park Square Mall. First, a person came to meet me—her partner—and explained that the senior partner, a lady, would come to meet me to see if I have the vision and mindset for the business and if I’m like-minded enough to partner.

The lady boss came for a general introduction. She didn’t say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better. She asked why I wanted to do business. My plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life. She responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere, and I insisted on not missing the monetary benefits. She asked why I hadn’t started earlier, and I said I didn’t have a clear idea to start with and didn’t want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case. Then she talked about the mindset of Zepto’s founders, a food delivery app, and how they succeeded even after dropping out. I called her out, saying she was wrong, and corrected her by saying Zepto is a food delivery app. She responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect.

I asked about the business, and she said I wouldn’t be able to fully understand it. Then she explained that they are in B2B e-commerce. They would set up my virtual distributor shop, and I would get distributorship rights for big corporations, selling to retailers. I would have 10-14% margins shared with all the partners. They work in collaboration, so if any other partner makes a sale, I get my share. I would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop.

There are two requirements: I have to make a quick decision and invest 4.5 lakhs. That 4.5 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop.

I asked follow-up questions, and she said she couldn’t tell me more about the business. Once I say yes and share my documents for verification, she would tell me more, and I would need to have the money ready. She said that once I get into the business, I would fully understand it.

I asked if I wanted to know more, is there a website or something I could read on. She said no, we are protected, and there is nothing on the internet. I asked her to send me at least some documents to read, and she said she had already told me everything required. She said I need to make my decision and have the money ready, and once I’m in the business, I would understand it fully. She added that if it were on the internet or so public, everyone would be doing this. We are exclusive and protected.

I had a heated discussion, and she left, asking me to make the decision and inform my friends. Then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner. I said that as a partner, we need to know each other and the business well. I can’t understand anything without being inside the business, she said. 

This friend is more of an acquaintance, and I don’t know a lot about her. How we met is an interesting story, but it doesn’t add any context here.

The job requires 2-3 hours a day, done digitally. That friend bought a car recently and quit her full-time job as well.

Sounds like an MLM scheme or scam to me. But is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it? What is this business, how does it operate? Is it legitimate?

I said no to join because I can’t be part of anything I don’t fully understand, and it’s not public or on the internet—anything protected and very private is a red flag for me, and I can’t put the money in it blindly.

One more thing, they kept calling each other sir/ma’am even though they are colleagues.",327,270,1731244088,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1go0aex/another_blr_scam/
1j7z3fa,bangalore,Transgenders extorted and forced my wife to pay 50 Rs in Sony signal,"My wife was in auto, apparently a large built transgender approached her and asked her money. She said ""no"". Then it seems they started to threaten her and told her to pay 50Rs. Thankfully for her, the signal turned green and left.

  
I have personally found so many instances, sometimes scary instances where they gang up if you refuse. In almost all prominent signals in Bangalore. One time I have seen a girl (probably in her 18s) cry after being threatend and forced to pay them and seen several cringe instances where they shamelessly harass women and men alike by touching and sexually harassing, finally resorting to threats.

  
Why are no actions taken? If they can make 20Rs per person and they can threaten 500 people per day, it seems like they can easily make 10,000 Rs per day minimum. This would be 3,00,000 Rs without any income tax per person. Won't this make more people to adopt this threatening extortion and form gangs? Right now it looks like an organised crime. If there are 50 transgenders, in a month as an association or a gang can command a 1 Crore per month making crime syndicate. 

  
Isn't this a public safety issue? How are they brazenly allowed -- I can understand how are they allowed given how much they make.

Is there an option to force police to take actions against them? Something like a collective petition or something so this falls under the category of organized crime? This seems like a public safety issue",340,129,1741614744,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1j7z3fa/transgenders_extorted_and_forced_my_wife_to_pay/
1n4lxg2,bangalore,Why mysore roads are so good and bangalore is not ?,"A different kind of rant. From time to time, I travel to Mysore because I love the city and the very easy-going drive from Bangalore to Mysore.

What I don’t understand is why Mysore’s roads are so good most of the time. They are wide, there’s not much of a garbage issue even during and after the rains, and there aren’t many speedbreakers.

And just 140 odd kilometers across, it’s totally the opposite here in our Bangalore city.

It’s the same government that runs both cities, right? If there’s a will and a way to keep that city lean and the way it should be, why not apply that will to Bangalore as well? What fails for banglaore ? 

And please don't get started on outsiders -- Umm.. (i will rather say, Indians from other regions) and blah blah.. they are not involved in town planning and civic maintenance.

1lnkybk,bangalore,Can incentives change how Bangalore drives? I am personally funding 1 lakh INR to pilot this.,"Edit: So this blew up. Many people have reached out, let's make this experiment happen. Will get back to everyone who wants to contribute. 



I want to run an experiment to see if we can get people to drive better by paying them when they do.

What if we paid people, even small amounts,to drive better?

Most Indian cities are clogged with traffic, honking, wrong-side driving, and stress. This is more true in Namma Bengaluru. It is not the same city as it was 20 years go.

Traffic problems are mostly due 3 reasons.

\- Bad Infra, No regulations for driving lessons, no discipline.

Everyone wants to go first, but no one is on time.

The idea is to have an app -  It tracks how you drive using just your phone sensors, accelerometer, gyroscope, mic and GPS. If you drive safely (no harsh braking, no crazy acceleration, no wrong way driving), you qualify for daily rewards.

(Edit: The more they show data points of good driving behavior, the more chances of winning more)

Rewards could be UPI cash, fuel vouchers and more.

It would have a voice-based AI co-pilot that says stuff like:

“Wrong way, turn back.”

“You’re honking a lot—everything okay?”

“Nice driving today.”

Before you comment:

\- Yes, this idea has been tried before, in the US, by insurance companies, even in India. But those efforts were bloated with infra requirements. Simplicity is key: it should just be an app. Nothing else.

\- Yes, it’s hard to make this sustainable long term. But as Charlie Munger said, “Show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome.” People respond to incentives, if you structure them well.

\- Yes, privacy is a real concern. For a full-fledged product, we’d need either strict anonymization or complex privacy tech. We can build that when we scale.

I’m personally funding this with 1lakhh INR to run a pilot and see if it actually changes how people drive. Can we change behaviour at scale?

If you’re:

\- A developer,

\- A behavioral scientist,

\- Into cities, traffic, or mobility,

\- Want to help build this,

\- Or just curious and want to test it when ready,

1l5dh91,bangalore,I got scammed by NoBroker for 19K: Lessons Learnt That I Want to Share,"Hi to all nodes of the network,  
I write this so that my experience, although painful to me, may bring awareness and benefit to others.

In short, the lessons I draw are thus,  
\* Do not trust anything that NoBroker executives say over call

\* Tell them to send the details of the flat/property over mail

\* Take every promise over mail or in any other written format. Everything else is a marketing gimmick

The complete story:

* I took The NoBroker Relax Tenant for plan (\~4k) in January 2025 (ironic, since this plan only gave me stress)
* Was shown a property in CV Raman Nagar but it was on a rooftop and there was something off about it
* After the property visit, the NoBroker RM (Relationship Manager) asked me if wanted the property for rent, I refused saying I had concerns if the construction was legal (I was clear about my requirements I wanted a legal construction with a legal address, with previous electricity bills for government purposes)
* As soon as I had expressed my concerns about the flat's legality, I got a slew of calls from various NoBroker executives (I will not take their names here because I don't want to blame an individual and I believe the work culture and pressure at NoBroker must be fault) trying to convince me that the flat is legal, it a has an address and assured me that the owner would share previous months' electricity bills too
* I told them I don't want to proceed without even knowing the actual flat number of the property (I vaguely remember when I visited the flat that I did not spot a flat number on the door)
* One RM from NoBroker lied to me over call and gave me some fake flat number. He assured me that ""NoBroker is a big brand"", that he has been in the company for long and that they verify every property and that ""every call is recorded""
* I was convinced by his smooth talk. I thought worst case the call has been recorded, and I can just point to the call if things go south (boy, was I wrong)
* So, to proceed I had to pay an advance of 15k (7k to NB, 8k to the owner). I did so. (I should have bought a ticket to Nepal, in hindsight, and run to the mountains)
* When the owner then shared the rent agreement with me, he had mentioned a flat number which was completely different from what the NoBroker RM had told me. I realized something was deeply wrong
* I visited the society and asked the security guard himself if such a flat exists. He smiled. I realized all the flat numbers in the society had three digits. The flat number given to me was 4 digits. It was an illegal construction on the terrace of the apartment which was being pushed off as a flat. I felt like a complete idiot
* I asked the owner about this, as soon as he saw my whatsapp message he deleted the rent agreement (image attached). I still have a copy of the draft rent agreement though
* I tried calling the various RMs about the lies. At first, they said they shall look into the issue. Then they stopped picking up my phone calls
* I talked to the NoBroker customer support multiple times. I even told them to check their recorded calls.
* NoBroker told me: No calls between NoBroker and me happened on that day and thus they have no records. This was so ridiculous it was funny! If no calls had happened, then how did the deal get closed?
* I realized it was an exercise in futility to approach NoBroker.
* I am considering my options now which include eJagriti or the Consumer Court but honestly because of personal commitments I do not know how to settle this issue without long court battles. I tried the National Consumer Helpline but they advised to me to go the consumer court.

However, what this experience has taught me is not trust the word of an exec but take every communication in mail.  
Thanks for your attention and may your day go well.  
\[Alas, I realize I cannot attach images in this thread\]

UPDATE:

Big thanks to you guys and the power of reddit, I was recently contacted by NoBroker and they agreed to refund a partial amount, 7k, (the NoBroker executive was able to identify the case with this reddit post and I was literally told on call this is regarding your complaint post on reddit). All those calls and follow-ups were futile but one post on reddit galvanized them into action. Apparently, it still is going to be a struggle to fetch the complete amount (12k remains) back and I have to see what my further options would be but reddit made a powerful impact.   
  
**Make no mistake I am still deeply disappointed by NoBroker** and would **not** recommend it to anyone, but I wanted to express my thanks to this community. Community expression and support can really be a powerful thing. To all those who texted me via chat, thank you for your support and sorry for not replying but I cannot seem to access the chat \[""Unable to join the room""\]. 

New Lessons Learnt,

\* Any community needs platforms for expression of voices to be heard

\* Consumers supporting other consumers is a force multiplier

\* If follow-ups, mails, calls fail, approach such a platform to raise awareness and you might be rewarded with something too :)

1hwdmui,bangalore,Beware of Phone Snatching Gang at New Horizon College Busstop,"My phone was stolen while exiting 500-CA Volvo BMTC bus. I immediately rushed home and locked it from my laptop. According to find my app, the phone is currently at Nagadevanahalli near NICE Road.

I reported the incident at Marathahalli Police Station and it would seem there have been multiple incidents at New Horizon Bus Stop. It seems there is a phone snatching gang that is currently running since the 7th at least at.

There mode of operation seems to be as below:
1. A huge crowd enters the bus at Kadubeesanahalli bus stop. 
2. They will completely crowd the area around the door. 
3. As you exit, a group will block you while someone steals the phone from your pocket.
4. If you realise that you lost your phone and try to re-enter the bus, someone will reply to you that a guy in a blue shirt took your phone. This is a ploy to make you exit the bus.

I received two live location updates from my iPhone. 

At 10:04 am, they were still near New Horizon College. So, they seem to be operating around 8 am - 10:30 am. 

At 11:36 am, they had proceeded to Nagadevanahalli. This may be a ping during transit or maybe the final location. Marathahalli police station can’t do anything because it’s not under their jurisdiction. The Police suggested to call 112 to request them to investigate the location.

1i224pe,bangalore,Auto Anna threatened me and almost took 8000 rupees from me,"Namaskara Bengaluru sub!

Today morning, I was on my way to office in my car (TN registered). Around 7:30 am at silk board signal (from electronic city towards outer ring road -- under the silkboard flyover), an auto anna suddenly started shouting at me as signal turned green and as vehicles started moving towards the outer ring road side. He eventually overtook and made to stop my car in a minute.

He came out from his auto and was shouting at me that I hit his auto on the back-right side part of his. I had no idea and almost certain that I didn't hit him. He was demanding 8K to fix it. Moreover it didn't make sense as he was behind me all the while. Clearly there was no damage on that, nor at any other places in the behind and right part of his auto. His tone was very rude, obviously. I didn't get out of my car and was lowering my window and speaking to him. Unfortunately, I don't know Kannada (trust me I'm learning Kannada and know very little - naanu kannada kalithaidini) and therefore was speaking in Tamil and English -- very politely; addressing him as Sir, Anna. He anyway got what I was saying and was responding in broken Tamil and Kannada. Luckily, contrast to my fear, he didn't take the language card all throughout his confrontation.

He tried to pull my car door with force shouting at me to get down. He tried to bang at my car. I was panicking, my anxiety levels were surging and wasn't sure how to get out of this mess. He tried stopping fellow other Auto mates to seek support, but fortunately no one stopped.

Vehicles started piling up behind my car and that made him to move his auto and I too started driving my car. He kept following on my left and he again stopped me. I didn't try to run away, as I really don't want to make it look like I was running away.  He again came down from auto and repeated same stuff. It dragged for some 10+ mins. All the while, I was kept saying I swear haven't hit you anna/sir. At some point, I was thinking if I should start negotiating that I can pay 2000 (or could go upto 4000) and settle it. Later, he started his auto and left.

For sometime, I wasn't sure what just happened. I was certain that he would be in front of me and again would stop me and threaten. I was driving little slower, thinking through all sort of scenarios. Nothing happened afterwards and I eventually reached office just in time for a 9 am meeting.",467,89,1736960708,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1i224pe/auto_anna_threatened_me_and_almost_took_8000/
1kpoixx,bangalore,All you need to know about Wonderla,"Wonderla is a good one-time experience! There is not a lot of information out there so we are putting down what we know. We took a regular non-AC bus from Majestic (226 N) towards Bidadi. We got off at Manchanayakanahalli Gate. We took an auto which dropped us directly to Wonderla's entrance (Rs 100 for 4 people + 1 kid). But if you are willing to wait for some time, Wonderla has private buses running a free pick-up service. (Immediately after taking an auto, we saw one such bus coming from Wonderla towards Manchanayakanahalli Gate.) BMTC runs a special service from Majestic directly to Wonderla, but it is more expensive (Rs 150/person).

Upon reaching the entrance, we were approached by a Wonderla salesperson who wanted to sell us Fast Track passes. We had already purchased our tickets online using the birthday BOGO offer. In our experience, this Fast Track pass is unnecessary. We went on Friday (16 May) and except for certain water rides, we didn't find ourselves stuck in long queues. Taking the extended pass (until 10 pm) is recommended.

As per the rules, they don't allow outside food. But the checking is quite relaxed. They even saw our biscuits and boxes of nuts/dry fruits and let us go. Maybe having a kid helps. 

Then we realised that we have to pay extra for a locker. There is no other place to keep your bags secure. It costs Rs 350 + 50 for one locker, of which Rs 50 is refunded after you return the key. It was disappointing to learn that Wonderla charges extra for lockers - a pretty basic requirement - despite such an expensive ticket. The locker can accommodate 2-3 laptop backpacks. 

We decided to go for water rides first. The dress code for water rides will be enforced, so please ensure you have the right clothes. There are shops outside and inside Wonderla which sell polyester jerseys, shorts, leggings, etc. It doesn't really matter what you wear, as long as the material is right.

The water rides section is great! It has everything for every age group. At the beginning, here are two separate 2 ft. pools with showers and small slides. Our 6 year old had a blast! We saw folks of all ages enjoying here. Every slide has a lifeguard at the beginning and at the bottom to help children and adults stay safe. They were working very hard the whole time and were well-trained. 

Then we went to the wave pool. There are specific timings for the waves to start. Each wave session lasts 20 minutes. There are separate sections for women + kids, couples + kids, and only men. This was lots of fun. If you want to be adventurous, you can go up to the front where the waves are generated. If you want to relax, you can stay on the shore side and chill in the light waves.

After this, we went to the bigger water slides. There were many different types. Here, the queues are long. Each ride took us atleast 20 minutes. But it is totally worth the wait! Some of these rides have a height restriction, so children may not be able to go on some of them. Water rides shut at 6 pm.

After this, we went back to the locker and changed into dry clothes. In the dry rides, our favourite was the Sky Wheel. You get two rotations of 1 minute each. This ride ends at 7 pm, and queues close at 6.30 pm. (Rest of the dry rides are open until 10 pm.) Then we climbed up the net walk (feels like a military training exercise but the adrenaline will help you) and went on the Carousel which was quite rough! (Subjective opinion.) There is a shop up here which is crazy expensive (only Baskin Robbins and Cornetto ice creams, and a simple waterproof plastic phone pouch costs Rs 350!). 

After this, we went on the Wonder Splash. The queue here is long because of the way the ride is organised. I personally did not like getting wet after having changed into dry clothes. If I knew, I would have clubbed this ride with the water rides. But it was fun!

Last, we went to Interstellar, Dungeon, and Termite. The Dungeon can be a bit creepy for kids but otherwise is your typical B-grade horror. Termite is a low-stakes rollercoaster. Interstellar is a 360 degree, immersive media experience. There is a huge IMAX screen with special effects that get activated as you move around and take part in a story. 

There are a bunch of dry rides especially for children too. The one with horses is nice, but make sure your kid sits on a horse with a vertical bar which will make it go up and down. The ones with elephants and a monkey are good too!

There are toilets scattered across the amusement park. All were clean and well-maintained. There are restaurants and eateries right after the entrance. We didn't eat a full meal but bought some snacks and coffee. Not very expensive. (Coffee was Rs 30.) We were there until 10 pm and booked a cab back to our place. If you are taking kids along, we recommend taking small breaks to eat and drink between rides. 

Hope this helps anyone planning their Wonderla trip!",615,39,1747587134,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1kpoixx/all_you_need_to_know_about_wonderla/
1fkd3b8,bangalore,Say no to toxic work culture ! Bengaluru needs you.,"During my mid- 20's ; I thought its ok to spend time in office since I am learning a lot. There was intense hunger to prove that you are a valuable player to the team. 

I still remember this, like it happened few weeks ago. I was clocking 70-80 hours a week at a stretch. I was doing lot of late night calls; trying to catch up with USA folks and work during the day in order to deliver the code. So, if I leave office at 1 am in the night ; it was common to get struck in old airport road traffic ; reach home at 3 am in morning. 

Again, I used to get ready by 6.50 am ; rush to the cab in order to be in office by 8.30am We( as a team) were doing for almost few months since we were trying to meet the tight deadlines. 



One night, my father was awake and opened the door for me. As I was about to bid him good night, he said that he wanted to speak and NOW ! Looking at this tone, I thought it might be something serious. He asked me lot of questions for next 30 mins. 

At the end of 30 mins, his 2 closing lines were - Your health is more important than your career. Dont spoil your health. 



That did not hit me hard at that time. But, in next 2 months ; when I started getting back pain, dry eyes etc. 

It hit me hard.

 Over the next few weeks, I spent lot of time thinking what should I do next. 

Lot of folks said, if I cant survive in consulting ; I am not fit for IT. 

Still, I decided to quit consulting and jumped into core ERP product development. 

It was not as sexy as consulting since I had to listen to customer issues, resolve them. I rarely meet them face to face. But, it was not as stressful as consulting assignments were. I am not trying to blame consulting , but the ecosystem is made up of team mates who are ready to burn the mid night oil. 

To stay relevant, one would end up being like the next consultant in your team. If things are not working your way, be ready to accept that and move on !I have not regretted moving out of consulting, because I knew that I wont enjoy that in long run. 

But, the initial few years in consulting has taught me lot of life skills which are useful even today. So, ability to pivot is more important than trying to save yourself from drowning.",728,67,1726721974,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1fkd3b8/say_no_to_toxic_work_culture_bengaluru_needs_you/
1mjrtvf,bangalore,Life imprisonment or luxury retreat? Taking a look at Bengaluru’s Broken Prison System and how Prajwal Revanna may never pay for his crimes.,"A special court in Bengaluru recently sentenced former JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna to life imprisonment in the mass rape case. After the verdict, he was sent to Parappana Agrahara Central Jail.

Given the high-profile and political nature of this case, I decided to take a closer look at the prison where he’s being held and what I found points to a disturbing pattern that will end up working in his favor.

Parappana Agrahara has a history of offering VIP treatment to powerful inmates from special kitchens to entire private cell blocks often in exchange for bribes. It’s not just speculation; this has been exposed before, most notably in the case of V.K. Sasikala. 

In 2017, [DIG Roopa exposed](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sasikala-paid-rs-2-crore-bribe-for-vip-treatment-in-jail-say-officials-tamil-nadu-4748396//) that V.K. Sasikala was receiving VIP treatment at Parappana Agrahara Jail, including private cells, a personal kitchen, and extended visiting hours. She alleged this was enabled by a ₹2-crore bribe to jail officials. **Shortly after this, she was transferred.** 

Much recently seven officials attached to the same prison[ were suspended](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2024/Aug/26/seven-officials-of-parappana-agrahara-prison-suspended-over-vip-treatment-to-actor-darshan) after they were providing special favor to actor Darshan, who was convicted in the murder case. What's worse is there have also been[ reports of intimidation](https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2017/07/25/notice-issued-to-dgp-ig-prisons-karnataka-over-allegations-of-inhuman-treatment-to-32-prisoners-in-bangalore-central-jail/) or violence against ordinary inmates who speak out or protest these irregularities.

Another disturbing pattern, is the involvement of the medical community which shows how corruption has permeated every level of the system. Very recently, a contract psychologist assigned to the hospital wing of the central prison, was [caught smuggling contraband](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/two-arrested-for-smuggling-mobile-phone-into-parappana-agrahara-jail-3586471). In another chilling case,  the psychiatrist [gave mobile phones and ASI security ](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-prison-psychiatrist-asi-mobile-phone-terror-convict-10116816/)details to a Lashkar-e-Taiba-linked terror convict.

When prisons meant to deliver justice become playgrounds for the powerful, what does that say about the state of our law? Parappana Agrahara is a mirror reflecting how deep systemic rot runs, from top officials to the medical staff entrusted with inmate care. If high-profile convicts like Prajwal Revanna end up shielded by the same machinery that once protected Sasikala or Darshan, then his life sentence is not justice, it’s just theatre to calm the people.

1ilbnot,bangalore,Bangalore vs UAE,"I've been curious about the Bangalore UAE debate.

The cost of living is skyrocketing every single day. Education, travel, housing, groceries and above all taxes. 

I would like to understand at what point would it make sense to move? (Salary wise)

If someone already travel 1.5hour one way to office everyday, wouldn't that be somewhat equivalent to the Sharjah/Ajman to Dubai travel?

If the rent in a decent residential locality in Bangalore is around 30k for a 2BHK, Sharjah ranges around 50-60k (limited research online) 

Not just rent, even freehold property rates are around 1.2-1.5x the price of Bangalore properties.

Education per year in Sharjah is around 10k AED ~ 2L which is on par with Bangalore school fees.

The safety in Bangalore is fine, not great but again the fear of not being a part of the majority religion in India haunts. (95% people of india are genuinely nice and respectful towards our beliefs but the political climate could have a nasty impact on secularism)

And as the UAE is as close to indian culture as India itself does it make sense to move?

The oversaturation of Bangalore and extremely poor infrastructure seriously questions the viability of this city in the long run.

1fg7g6a,bangalore,Empire Koramangala scam,"After a busy Friday at office, I decided to check out the empire restaurant in Koramangala. Had heard a lot of hype around it. It was nearly full, and I had to wait 5-10 mins before getting seated. 

What’s surprising is, they didn’t seem to provide menus to anyone. Had some excuse that they had run out of menus at night or something like that. We ordered a half chicken tikka biryani, and peri peri fried chicken. The waiter ofc didn’t reveal the prices and we didn’t bother to ask, since the prices on swiggy were usually quite cheap. The waiter tried to upsell the order by asking for salad, soup etc. Mind you, he didn’t say green salad but tried to sell it off as complimentary onions along with biryani.

When the bill came the total amount was : 1029 INR

Breakdown: 

Peri peri chicken (easy bites)4 PC - 419 INR
Half chicken tikka biryani - 499 INR
Green Salad - 62 INR

Taxes n roundoff - 49 INR

Throughout my time in Bangalore I’ve never had such a terrible and ridiculously overpriced biryani. I was able to click a picture of the bill but the waiter didn’t let us keep the final bill. Never visiting that place back again.

Edit: The time was around 1:25 AM so didn’t bother even checking if Meghana was open or not. Didn’t specifically go for biryani, just wanted to have some late night snack (where the waiter recommended biryani).

The lesson I’ve learnt is to stop using Rapido because not only is our personal information compromised, their customer support’s response was also terrible through this whole ordeal. They have no protocols in place for these kind of incidents and were asking me to decide if they should give the driver a “final warning” or suspend him. This proves that they are totally okay with allowing such drivers to function in the fleet. Suspending him immediately would jeopardise my safety as the auto driver would realise I had made the complaint, so I asked them to suspend him in a few days, but honestly I don’t think they will.

This company is running with no regard for customer safety and now I’m a 100% sure that even in a more serious emergency Rapido would have been totally useless.

I booked an auto via rapido. The driver called to confirm where the pick up point was and said he’s on his way. I waited for a few minutes but the driver’s location hadn’t changed at all on the app’s map. I was in a rush so I canceled and got another auto. 5 mins later I got a call from an unknown number. It was the driver and he was abusing me for cancelling the auto. I don’t know how he got my number since the ride was canceled on the app. 

He’s been calling me non stop every minute. I have 20 missed calls from him. My drop location was my house. I’m worried that he has access to it and will show up there. 

Rapido support is slow and useless. I’m stuck in a chatbot loop. What can I do to keep myself safe? This has never happened to me before.

1iodw65,bangalore,More to ORR Traffic & Blr- Rant/Opinion,"It might be long so feel free to skim through.

# About Traffic

I usually take the bus—not that it’s great but I'd rather have mental peace than the stress of driving in Blr. The point is, when I took my scooter to work today, not only did I have a horrible start to the day but I felt SO bad for people **driving their own vehicles** to work in that route (daily). The roads are a mess-the potholes, the dust, the poorly planned underpasses and the illegal encroachment. Everything is so so chaotic and people are still fighting traffic & time- riding on footpaths, shatters from construction work, over rocks and debris TO GET TO OFFICE IN TIME. It’s literally to GO AND WORK!

# Lifestyle and downgrade

How low have our standards fallen? It makes me furious and also **sad** that we pay so much in taxes yet endure a subpar lifestyle. Karnataka has the highest RTO tax, and this is what we get. People working 8-9 hours a day, commuting for 3 hours, and sleeping < 8 hours are made to believe they’re hustling—when in reality, it's an unhealthy lifestyle that's been glorified. Issues like cardiac arrest, hair loss, and diabetes can easily be traced back to this. We’re heading in the wrong direction.

# Improving Traffic

On top of it all, the bus and metro fare hike? It's baffling! While we know there are obvious solutions to improving traffic like WFH, wider roads, faster work, better planning etc, the no-brainer, win-win solution is to improve **Public Transport.** Yes, public transport can single-handedly improve traffic in this city. Metro will take time to see widespread usage but BMTC buses are an immediate available solution.

# Further on BMTC busses to improve traffic

There's a Vajra (AC) bus **500-CA** which runs between Banashankari <> ITPL via Jayanagar, BTM, Silk Board, HSR BDA, Agara, Bellandur, Kadubeesanahalli, Mahadevapura and so on. It covers a good chunk of dense residential and workplace hubs. They also run every 5-10 mins I think. Then what's the problem? That is **NOT ENOUGH.** The seats are filled as it leaves Banashankari (which is good) but even by the time it reaches BTM or Silk Board, it's packed to the brim- leaving hardly any room to stand. Commuters board with frustration and disappointment knowing they have another 1-1.5 hours of travel ahead without **space to stand**!

Increasing the frequency of these buses will easily attract more footfall- especially on this route where people have the affluence to pay for comfort (AC) and convenience. It may be difficult to tackle in other locations but the ORR and Sarjapur Road- where most companies are located—should be a straightforward, revenue-friendly, and eco-conscious solution.

# Koramangala to Sarjapur road

This road is supposed to be better than ORR, yet no one talks about how bad it really is. From St. John's to Jakkasandra, it's mostly decent—wide roads with only a few potholes and construction debris. But that doesn’t mean it gets a free pass forever. Two nearly invisible speed breakers—one at St. Francis and another near the Water Tank—are accidents waiting to happen. In daylight, they’re hard to spot; at night, they’re practically invisible. I’ve seen countless close calls, and once, the auto I was in got rear-ended by a Thar because the driver **couldn’t see the speed bump**!

Beyond Jakkasandra, the situation gets worse—potholes, half-finished construction, and dust so thick it single-handedly lowers the AQI. The road starts wide but keeps narrowing—a highway at the start, a goat path by the time you reach Agara. From Agara to Sarjapur Signal, it's downright dreadful. The service road beside the flyover barely has space for a single car at a time. What were they even thinking when they built this? These are some of the busiest roads in the city, yet they’re built like an afterthought. Kudos to development!

# Conclusion tl;dr- a disheartening realisation

I’m just very sad today. I usually steer clear of these but today has been a sinking mix of frustration, disappointment and helplessness. Blaming the city, the departments, the government, the bosses, their bosses, the companies and so on. I relate to Ambi from the movie Anniyan/Aparichit. We thought he was a loser but today we’re all taking the L’s. If anyone reading this has the knowledge, sources and resources to fight for the bare minimums, you will have the support of millions of taxpayers in Blr.

1fvu43s,bangalore,There are people who are still trusting in this city ,"So today I was traveling from my office to the sub-registars office in Gandhinagar for some work related thing. I booked an auto through uber and when I reached the location, I tried to pay through UPI (the amount was around Rs. 200) but for some reason my payment didn't go through. It said that my bank was experiencing a lot of transactions. I tried to look for cash but to my dismay I realised that I didn't have any cash on me. I explained the situation so the auto guy, and said that if he's okay I'll take a picture of his scanner and pay him later. He was like ok that's no problem. I was was expecting him to complain a little say something. But nope he was completely okay with the situation. I even offered to tell him my number or give him my business card he said that's not required. You take my number and call/text me to say you've sent the money. 

I was quite taken aback my his reaction because it wasn't 30-50 (not that this amount is insignificant) but in comparison.  The crazy thing is the a few days ago or a few ago I had taken another auto and my data wasn't working so I told the auto guy to wait I'll run up and get cash he was like it's ok you take a picture of the scanner and send the money to me and left. These type of small incidents has   several times over the last 20+ years I've lived here, so many vendors (tender coconut sellers, momo guys) have for whatever reason not having correct change or UPI not working have always said it's okay give next time. 

I'm sure I'm not alone in this experience, but some how it feels that when you're in a corporate job or a proper office job people get so jaded and simply don't trust eachother I wonder why this happens.

1if5fp1,bangalore,My experience working as a teacher for exactly one month [Rant],"hi r/bangalore, buckle up, this is going to be a long post, very rant-based and this should probably go on google reviews or glassdoor but lol.

i'm a blr native and i recently landed a job at a pretty reputed school known for its brand in bangalore especially. i'm also a student and i'm doing my diploma in education on the side. for experience while i study, i thought i could take up a job and to my absolute joy, i got referred by my parent's colleague to this school.

i attended the interview in december. prior to this, i got no call from the school officially, all communication was being done through the teacher who had recommended me which was already weird to me. either way, i went in for the interview and the environment was weird from the get go. receptionists were acting as if they were prison wardens but i brushed it off and tried to focus on the interview ahead. before going in, they took my phone and locked it up in a box and explained that they have a strict no phones inside campus policy, teachers included.

principal was alright, spoke with me fine. but the vice principal was being all thorny. asking me if i'm planning to get married soon and all that, which is none of their business. as i spoke to them, i slowly recognized that they were against using modern technology in classes beyond the obvious smart boards that every school has nowadays. they even said technology is the bane of our existence and so on. this felt a bit uncomfortable to me because i'm training to incorporate ICT into all subjects for more modern competency based education. but either way, i agreed because i was in desperate need for a job—both for financial reasons and to gain an edge in my resume going forward. they insisted that i submit my original documents if i want to discuss salary (which was meagre, nothing to say of note here) and i expressed that that made me uncomfortable because they're my ORIGINAL documents (10th, 12th, college degree, etc.)

to appease them and at least confirm the job, i agreed to submit one of my 12th grade marksheet which was the least of priority among the documents that i held. they asked me to submit the rest when i joined. i said sure, and left and at this time i knew something felt shady. they also did not give me any acknowledgement for the document that i had submitted, saying that it is school policy. which is so ??? is that what we're calling illegality now?

flash forward to after i joined, i discovered countless red flags that i documented meticulously in case they decide to turn against me.

1. no appointment letter / offer letter for up to a month after i joined. virtually NO confirmation of my employment there.
2. STRICT dress code for teachers, even my college was more relaxed than this, trust. no palazzo pants or leggings because apparently that would distract the older kids.
3. no canteen or food options at all. can't order outside as well. no bringing non-veg to school, even eggs count.
4. no toilet paper in toilets. if you want toilet paper there, we have to crowdfund for toilet paper and get it installed. i'm not kidding this is what we were told.
5. fines for literally EVERYTHING. door closes loudly? pay up 500 bucks on spot. wear pants that show your ankle a bit? 250 for that please. speak in tamil for a few seconds? FUCK YOU. pay up 2500 from your salary.
6. no information goes inside or outside school. they have a computer lab for namesake but everything gets monitored down to tee. can't login or use personal accounts including gmail or google drive. computers were coded to not even detect usb drives lmfao.
7. they took us on a fuckass staff picnic. and you'd think staff picnic means the school would sponsor it but nope. we had to pay 3k compulsorily to go on a one day trip to fucking anekal of all places.
8. they almost coerced me to sign the agreement a couple days ago but i vehemently disagreed and declined based on how pushy they were being. probation itself was for two years lol.
9. the entire school is just one big building and a measly looking basketball court. genuinely felt like a jail complex, i won't lie.
10. secular school but everything is hindu religious (this is a minor factor but it still annoyed me, sorry)

[edit: remembered a couple more things]

11. teachers have no desks inside classes, we are expected to keep standing throughout the class, throughout the day.

12. cctv cameras at every corner of the campus including inside classrooms. everyone gets watched for their every move at all times, literally some surveillance dystopia.

i noped the fuck out and walk away from that place just yesterday. i'm so glad and lucky to have gotten my certificates back in one piece because all my other colleagues have since called me to tell me that they're holding their documents hostage and they're unable to leave despite handing in their resignation, which i'm sure is illegal on some counts?

anyways, i'm glad to have dodged a bullet and cut my losses. if you've read till here, please let me know if i should namedrop this school because i'm not sure if this will get approved either. have a nice day, my people 🫂

1gsiamc,bangalore,Sarjapur Road is hell!,"No matter if its working day or holiday, Sarjapur Road is always jammed right from Doddakannalli to ORR junction in Bellandur. I recently moved to Kasavanhalli near Amrita College Road and even this road is jammed every morning extending from the traffic jam in Sarjapur road. Commuting in this area is such a headache, taking minimum 40 minutes to travel just 3 kms. After facing the traffic woes, I decided to walk everyday to office situated in Sarjapur road 3 kms from home, and that was even worse. Though I reached office much faster, it is nothing short of an adventure. Pedestrian footpaths just don't exist here, and if they exist, they are used by the two-wheelers or occupied by the vendors or parking vehicles. In many places, footpaths are broken having open drains underneath. Sometimes pedestrians don't have a way ahead as the whole road is occupied by vehicles and there is no space to walk. These swiggy zomato guys also always ride their yulus like they are gonna run over you. And on top of that had to cross through the dust flying all around in the air, vehicle smoke, a open dumpyard right on the middle of the road and the stinking Kaikondrahalli lake. This area also gets inundated whenever it rains for more than 30 mins. Rents in this area are also sky high. A normal 2 bhk costs you around 30k, and if you need some luxury like society then it goes more than 45k.

1gceau8,bangalore,8 months in Bangalore. From hate to acceptance ,"I have lived my entire life in Mumbai, born in a small village called Moodbiduri in Karnataka, I can kinda speak kannada as I visit my village once a year. 

When I got an internship opportunity in Bangalore in such a tough market I was excited, leaving Mumbai was tough seeing my cry dad for the first time and gf just loosing her shit as I hopped on to the bus. 
Bangalore wasn't kind to me, initially. I hated it here. The street food here was trash, the public transport here was just simply underdeveloped. I remember not being able to navigate from Koramangala to Banashankari through bus. Being from Mumbai, and having the privileged to travel the entire city using public transport with no hassle, just feeling of not having reliable public transport and subpar street food instilled a sense of hate in me for this place. 
 For a couple of months that is (not that I have come to like these aspects of banglore now)

Now that it's been some months and I've finally gotten my first job here. I've kinda accepted Bangalore. No I don't feel home, but I realise I was expecting the wrong things from Bangalore which instilled the disappointment in me. 

The restaurants here are simply amazing, you can easily try authentic regional food made by the natives of that place so easily. (I am in love with Kerala cuisine)

What can I say about the weather. Coming from the humid sticky climate of Mumbai, this weather is just beautiful. Tho I end up feeling sooooo sleepy lmao. 

The gardens here are beautiful, from the lush trees of cubbon park to small gardens locally, it's nice have a place where u can just chill and relax, trust me it's not common back in my city. 

The people here are so full of ambition, I've never been so humbled. This place has filled me with a lot of courage to do well in life. 



No Bangalore is far from being perfect, yes there are some goons and idiots who ruin the image of this place, yes there are a shit ton of scams on the road which makes u doubt if being kind to people is the right way to go. But  Bangalore isn't all that bad. Maybe one day I'll make friends I can hang out with here. Maybe.

1g5ws4l,bangalore,Traumatized!! I got flashed by a man on my college campus ,"Hey guys I am an  mbbs student.
So an unfortunate incident took place on our college campus.
Our college is not safe and the security is useless.
I was walking behind the hospital building which is the nearest route to go out if you don't have a vehicle and many hostellers take that route and some unknown guy started to unzip his pants and didn't stop even after yelling at him.
He went on to remove his pants and put his dick out and started approaching me.I yelled at him and he began to run and I ran behind him.
Not single security guard showed up though I was yelling until a few junior boys noticed and went behind him.
He ran towards the  parking and jumped the wall and escaped.This was at 6:50 pm yesterday.
If the security did respond on time he would be caught .
The area behind hospital has zero security .

I was having a panic attack right after and someone from the management had the audacity to ask why I was alone and why I took that route and how I shouldn't mention about this to anyone and only then things will get solved.

This wasn't any student but some guy in his 30s.
He is either a worker or some random person who has entered campus or a patients attender .
The walls of our college facing the adjacent road don't even have barbs to prevent people from jumping into the campus. 
I made sure the Dean and the wardens know about it and have a meeting with them soon.

I am traumatized and I feel super unsafe to even step out to go to the hostel canteen. 

Update: Hey guys thankyou soo much for your support 
Necessary changes to be made has been put forward 
To increase cctv and security and to put barbs or glass pieces on the wall of the compound 
And to make a note of the cars and any vehicles numbers that enter the hostel or hospital premises 
A signed and sealed letter has been submitted to the civil department to make necessary changes.
A formal complaint has been filed by the Dean to the police along with the cctv footage",421,48,1729187138,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1g5ws4l/traumatized_i_got_flashed_by_a_man_on_my_college/
1m5ssph,bangalore,"Dear people, humble request. Please clean your feet and come to theatre.","Dear people, a humble request that please just be a little bit cautious about your feet and socks before coming to theatre.

Now I understand that it could not only be a problem in Bangalore and I'm not way saying or implying that, just getting it out of the way. It could very well be a general issue all over India and maybe even world. I'm just putting it here because I've gone to more than a couple of malls and movie theatres across Bangalore (Bengaluru) and have faced this issue almost everywhere.

Smelly socks smell create a lot of disturbance back of the mind and it really ruins the movie watching experience mostly for people sitting beside us. Sometimes the smell is just unbearable to a point where people are not able to sit beside or enjoy movie snacks like popcorn, drinks, fast foods etc. 

Till we don't have solutions like socks that can't smell or perfume socks or central perfume inside the whole theatere, we should consider the experience of others 🙏

Some of the socks smell really bad. Here are some of the things we can do.

1. If possible wash your feet before coming to the theatre. Best thing to be done. Just wash em and come wearing a slider or a different sock with shoes, sliders etc

2. For the folks coming directly from office to enjoy a movie... If you know you have worn dirty socks then just don't remove the damn shoes. It's really that simple. Generally the smell that bad wouldn't come if shoes are on, the problem starts when people take the shoes off while knowing that they have been wearing the socks from like last 9 days. I can understand adult life and we all like to enjoy a good movie but if you know your socks will smell then for the sake of everyone else, just don't take off your shoes.

Nobody likes to eat overly taxed caramelized & cheddar cheese popcorn with that smell. So please let's all be a bit more responsible as people. Putting it out here hoping few people see it and we all apply it in our lives. Let's all be responsible for ourselves until some solution comes where we don't have to worry about such problems.

But until then, let's all be a bit more responsible citizens and think about others as well and about the public experience while we are in public.",89,37,1753126913,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1m5ssph/dear_people_humble_request_please_clean_your_feet/

* **Saturdays and public holidays**: The metro runs from 6 AM to 10:30 PM on the second and fourth Saturdays

Why BMCRL is so conservative in operating metro from 05.00 AM to 11.30 PM everyday and adjust the Frequency of train during peak hours and other hours.

1.Late night Travelers find metro more safe than BMTC and opting for cabs  
2. Early morning travelers who come in early morning literally don't have any options except BMTC and this is not only for Mondays.

1jsrenv,bangalore,NO BROKER Movers & Packers- TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ( PLEASE AVOID THEM),"I took Nobroker services, while some of my friends had advised me against taking their services as they are an aggregator and as a customer I will have no control on the final vendor who does the service - I think in hindsight I should have paid heed to my friends. 

  
The horror story started 5 days after my consignment was packed and sent to Bangalore warehouse - I checked the app to see that the consignment is lying there. To my surprise no one from No broker cared to contact me. The only time I was contacted was when I had to make my second tranche of payment 

In my order I had clearly called out a 15 day warehouse facility in Delhi my destination. It was in line with my plan to let the goods leave Bangalore by 1st/2nd April and reach Delhi by 15th of April - then move to warehouse. Meanwhile I will reach Delhi do some house hunt and get a rented apartment post which I will get this delivered ( Tentatively around third to 4th week of Apr) 

I frantically called the vendor who nonchalantly told me how does it matter if your goods are in Bangalore/ Delhi warehouse. Its cheaper in Bangalore and your goods are safe here. You get a rented apartment, call me 3-4 days in advance and I will get your goods delivered. 

( Some stats - Delhi Bangalore takes 36 hrs in Rajdhani with an air distance of over 2000kms) - A truck will easily take 2 weeks in transit with rest time of the driver included . I calling 3-4 days in advance will mean a waiting time of around 15 days after getting an address at my destination and I pay half months rent while staying in some hotel/ friends place. IN short my entire plan is gone out of the window. 

Horror story continues- I called the grievance team at NB. They first confirmed that they have gone through the call records between me and the sales person where they found that I needed a warehouse in Delhi only and not in Bangalore and that they will resolve it ( This is on 5th Apr evening) . Today on 6th April the stance completely changes - Supposedly I had asked for a warehouse at source ( Why would I do that - what % of population seek a warehouse at source ) Unless there is some rarest of rare case no one would need a warehouse at source. Also, no one will share a Call record / chat transcript with the customer and they will now offer you warehousing in Delhi at a cost  So you now have to believe what the internal grievance team is telling you. Now you are stuck... you have already paid for warehouse in Delhi and now probably they will charge you again - because your plan cant change. You will end up paying 

Hence, Please stick to companies - Like Agarwal (Not Bade Bhaiya) , Transworld, Maxwell etc who have their own trucks, Teams and the customer doesn't have to talk to the vendor / the aggregator and waste time and energy justifying. 

Also, I made another mistake ... I did NOT read the fine print when the order confirmation came. It was a weekday and in the past I never had any issues with understanding with the transporter as to what my need is (which is warehousing at destination) - but here you don't pay attention to what's the fine print and what is given to you in writing you are in trouble. 

Stay away from companies who run call centers from some 2BHK in Bangalore and call themselves as one "" Integrated service provider for all Home related stuff"" - They will first undersell you against their competitors and then extract their pound of flesh once you are trapped with your entire household goods in their warehouse.

1n1losz,bangalore,Pet Euthanizing/funeral - Everything you need to know,"I would like to share the events that happened today upon my pet's death, covering quite a lot of difficult topics. Could be a rant or awareness for pet parents in Bengaluru. 

My furry friend, Labrador, 12 years old, has been suffering from chronic kidney condition and difficulty to breathe due to trachea related issues due to age. He lived a very disciplined life, a true family member who wouldn't, would never, do his business inside the house, would wait for me to get back home or finish my work, to go out, never would create problems in the apartment, always friendly, to everyone around, always happy and wagging. 

Since the past few weeks he has struggled to do his basic needs, wouldn't want to go out, stopped drinking water since the last three weeks, no usual food intake. Now comes the difficult decision and I had no clue how I gained courage to accept it. I had to talk about the difficult topic of euthanizing him to my family. We decided to wait but he could not walk, his legs would bent down in pain and I managed to take the decision and made my family agree to it. He cannot live that life after living so well, he needs a good send off, it's not about taking care of him for the rest of his life, but it was about the quality of life he lived and the struggle he went through in the past few weeks, not responding to any medical help. 

Jeeva Hospital, both JP nagar and Kanakpura branch , were his clinics for consultation and vaccination and also the place for his critical care in the past few weeks. 

We used their ambulance service from my home to the clinic first, the doctor helped complete the procedure and my friend was put to sleep immediately, totally painless, and thats probably the best decision we could take for him. For pet parents struggling to decide when there is no way of improvement, I reassure you that its never easy to decide, but your furry friend does not understand death, end of life or anything related and you have to let go to make sure they have a good end to their life. 

Now comes the part of funeral. The BBMP crematorium in Sumanahalli has been out of order for the past few months. The only easy way to electrically cremate pets in the city run by the government isn't functional and nobody really cares about it. At a cost standpoint, that's the easiest any pet parent could afford, if they don't own their land in the city or would like to cremate their furry friend. Now that isn't working so we have to make last minute calls and enquire about funerals. Comes the package options from different vendors, 9k, 16k, 30k and so on. And that's when I wondered, how could someone who has a pet and has to bury them, give them a good send off, be able to afford this? 

The only option we had was to take him to PFA wildlife rescue and conservation centre in Sunkalpalya. Very respectfully completed all the rites. Easy process. Excellent management. 
They have packages for burial that starts at Rs. 5,500  for an year of hold, 20k for 3 years, 30k for 5 years. You have the option to extend later too. I had selected the 1 year plan and later enquired about having a tombstone with engraving or pictures that could be done and included in the 3/5 year package. We could revisit and decide to extend the plan anytime within this period too. You also get a receipt and the money goes into donation of the conservation centre, can be claimed for tax returns too.

Im not guilty, he lived a good life and we were able to give him a good send off too. But what concerns me is for someone who cannot afford, it's a challenge not to have and be confused about a burial place. 

With my previous furry friend's death, around 7 years ago, we had used the service of the BBMP crematorium and it was very affordable. We also retained her ashes in an urn, preserved till date and we used that today during his funeral. We plan to invest on an engraved tombstone and an extended plan at the PFA centre for the both of them. 

I wanted to sound as practical and easy as possible in this post possibly to help someone who is going through a similar situation. As I said, it's never easy, but it's the best we could do for them. There is a huge gap in my routine, a gap in our lives that will stay. But he lived a good life according to us. And I'm sure he was happy with us. Always playful and a joy to be with. 

Advice for the ones who read through the post so far,
Watch your pets diet seriously, manage weight, do not decide to ""buy"" pets if you cannot manage, maybe adopt or donate to animal welfare. Medications are expensive, treatments are expensive. If you can, we have insurance options for pets in India now, make use of it. I have an overall experience of handling and living with dogs for 15 years, please feel free to ask me anything. I hope you have a great time with your furry friends and decide what's ONLY best for them. 

TLDR: Lab/12 YO, suffered chronic kidney issues, got euthanized, struggled a bit to find out burial space, BBMP crematorium temporarily closed, managed it all well at the end.

Costs
Ultrasound scans, xrays, medicines: 12000-15000
Ambulance from Jeeva Hospital - Pick up and drop - 2000 (depends on distance too)
Euthanize Charges: 2000
Burial minimum charges: 5500

1lts98e,bangalore,Wildcraft Brigade Road Store (Bangalore) – Scam Alert!,"Just wanted to share a shocking experience at the Wildcraft store on Brigade Road, Bangalore – so that others don’t fall into the same trap.

We recently visited the store and were offered a “special” 10% discount, which the staff claimed was just for us, after multiple requests from us. We accepted it and proceeded to pay. When we asked for a bill, the salesperson casually said it would be sent later. That was our first red flag.

A couple of days passed and we still hadn’t received the bill. We raised a complaint and visited the store again. This time, another staff member printed the bill on the spot, and guess what? The bill had extra items (like a duffle bag and other products we never bought) added just to match the total amount we had paid. None of those items were with us. And the shoes had 40% discount applied—exactly what we should have gotten in the first place.

We escalated the issue to the store manager, and thankfully, the extra amount was refunded the next day. But it was a clear scam—manipulating bills, hiding actual discounts, and adding fake items. Furthermore, that employee when caught, claimed that we had requested only for a 10% discount instead of the actual 40..I mean sure!!!

What’s shocking is that this happened at such a well-known location like Brigade Road. Please be cautious if you're shopping there! Please insist on the bill immediately, and verify all listed items and discounts.

Stay safe, folks. ✌️

1mndagr,bangalore,Some experiences in Bangalore that shook me and some that touched my heart,"I will just post a compilation of both heartwarming as well as negative interactions I had in Bangalore over the past few days working as a Zomato delivery partner.   
(Pardon my grammar and narration style for any mistakes or inconsistencies)

I was mired in some deep personal issues relating to divorce and lots other and had to quit job back in March. (Big time regret). Now I am unable to get any opportunities and hence decided to join Zomato to earn a livelihood until i land a decent job. here are some of the experiences that hurt me and some that touched me:

 **1. The rude lady**: After picking my order from the restaurant, I reached the location on time and reached the customers doorstep. There was no response even after ringing the bell. So I gave her a call and she started yelling at me for being in the wrong location. She called me ""incompetent"" and told me that I cannot even do a simple job like delivery.  
My English had a slight accent as well and she picked it mid way and passively mocking my accent with someone in the background as I pronounced it as ""dɪˈlɪv(ə)ri"" and she started highlighting it to her friend saying the ""the dɪˈlɪv(ə)ri person couldn't find the location"" and all. Somehow mentioned the location as a parlour and I made my way to there which was 1.5km from her given location.

Apparently she ordered some drinks to parlour but ended up ordering it to her home address. I didnt reason with her much, but just let her know what had apparently happened. She just told it might have been an app issue and left. No sorry, nothing. I exchanged a friendly smile and left.

**2.** **The chain snatch incident**: On my way to pick up an order, a cow jumped in front of me from my blind spot and in order to avoid a collision, I tried evading and fell on the road. Luckily the speed wasn't much, but i ended up bruising my knees and feet badly. My feet got stuck in the wheel alloy and from that day I am limping. A few people who were standing in the roadside were quick to respond, helped me up and parked my bike on the side. Those were some genuinely good people. 

I was so pissed off that people are letting their cattle loose on a highway but suddenly I felt it. Someone was trying to pull mu gold chain. My chain was tangled with the waterproof mobile pouch which I was wearing across my neck and as the person pulled it, i could quickly feel my phone lift up a bit. I immediately held my chain and looked back unable to figure who it was since there were a lot of people assembled around me. I was bleeding, I was in pain, I was high on adrenaline, but this incident really shook me. I swiftly took off and left the place en-route collect my next order.

**3.** **The very kind security person**: It was raining badly and I wasn't getting any orders. SO i thought to settle and await an order in a fast paced food spot. There were quite some restaurants there very adjacent to each other. I parked my vehicle and was limping to shelter and this old man saw me limping from a distance. He ran all the way to me and told me not to strain much, just let him know the order number and he will collect it on behalf of me.

I was so touched by the kind gesture of this man. I let him know that I haven't had any order yet and was just heading for a tea. I was feeling so overwhelmed my this kind gesture. 

4. **A mean bunch**: I reached the drop location and called the person and they let me know that they resided in the 5th floor. I looked up to see that they waved their hands to come to the top. I was limping, but in no way I was slow. I limped all the way to the top and i could hear the ladies talking in Malayalam where once girl was asking the other in Malayalam if that Limp legged Ma\*\*\*\*(cuss word in malayalam) hasn't come yet and the other person replied back to her saying that by the time that Ma\*\*\*\*(cuss word in Malayalam), it will be night.  
In no way I was slow. I was walking in the same pace as any normal human do. I felt bad, but this is how it is. Everyone was things so fast these days. I immediately showed up and suddenly it dawned on them that i might have heard them. I pretended as if I dint understand their language, proceeded to exchange a casual smile, handed their package and left.

5. **An angel of a lady**: I was heading to a delivery and as I crossed the road, I saw an old man with a walking stick struggling to put his chappal on. I without any hesitation bend down and helped him with it. He gratuitously told something in Kannada (which i didn't understand at all, but it made me feel happy).   
I proceeded to the 1st floor for the delivery where this lady was already standing in the corridor to collect the order. She collected the older and told me that i was a very good man. Apparently she she saw me helping the old man. I thanked her for being so nice and she invited me for a lunch. I lied to her saying that I did had my lunch just now only and thanked her for her benevolent gesture. Still she gave me some lime water and asked if I need anything else for my travel like snacks and all. I again lied to her that I am finishing my shift and left.

Her beautiful smile stayed with me. A lot of people has been mean to me in different ways, but never have my eyes turned wet. But now I as I drove to the next pickup location, I felt warm drops of tears rolling down my cheecks. Guess I could take all the hate in this world, But I am not used to getting love or people being nice to me.

6. **A very chill and open-minded guy**: It was late in the evening. My phone was already running out of charge. So as I reached a customer location, I asked the person if he could plug in my phone for charge for a good 5 minutes. This guy agreed and he invited me into his place. I told him i was good standing outside, but he insisted, made me sit, offer some water and before leaving even offered me that sweet peanut candy.  
I left that place with a feeling of warmth and happiness in my heart.

7. **The entitled lady**: I had a delivery at  facility which I believe was some sort of quarters or hostel facility for medical students/Doctors. The security wasn't allowing delivery person inside and asked me to call the concerned person. I called the person and waited for a good 10 minutes. It also started drizzling lightly. It was already 10 mins, I followed up again with a call to see that her phone was busy. I tried again to get shouted at asking why cant you wait a bit?

Now the drizzle has turned into a full blown rain and that too subsided after 5 mins back to a drizzle. Now this lady stepped out from the facility. Now it was nearing 20 mins. Guess  I should have reported to customer care already, but I gave her a call again. I realised that she was the one who exited the facility now and she is stalling talking to someone while making me wait in this cold rain. Again after a few minutes once she finished the call, she came and picked up my order.

No excuses for stalling, no apologies, not even an acknowledgement. Came and collected the package as if the entire purpose of my birth was to wait for her and then left just like that.

These experiences has really been a life-changer for me. They have really taught me a lot and reminded me of how good my life was when i just worked on weekdays in an A/C cabin with full blown facilities. I c consider each and every experience as a precious gem that is molding and shaping me into a better person with grit and resilience. 

But deep down I still wish the world would have been a better place with more nice people in it.",201,16,1754919658,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1mndagr/some_experiences_in_bangalore_that_shook_me_and/

The UPI system very widely used which helped remove the exact change issues.But the scanner which is key for commuters and buses even is kept in a corner of the buses accesing being difficult. On top of this the over crowd due to so less number of buses. 

Driver rides roller coaster....

The conductor rudely shouts. Scan maadri. Yellaruu maadta ilvaa!. She has a scanner hard copy in hand but arrogant enugh to shout at commuters to go to the door and scan for UPI payment...if you step aside from your safe space of balancing yourself during driving you will surely have a fall. Anyone there to lift you??Who will bear for this rude behaviour and damage from falling?? 

Sudden brakes so common in every regular bus stops..

When few drivers are able to apply brakes smoothly keeping safety of passengers..why few drivers are rash enough to apply sudden brakes and make even alert people fall over? 

Bus route decided onnthe fly....

The instance occured yesterday in the BMTC AC Vajra bus route KA 57F0804 evening 4 pm from ITPL. I board the bus and conductor says rudely  scanner is near entrance go scan it. Bartaa nee scan maadi barbeku antha gotilvaa. Is this how you treat a customer who uses your service ?. Is there a board or notification about this that she makes such statement so rudely!!. Is anyone teaching them how to behave with commuters.Then a person says i need ticket to Agara. Though the stop is in the route - Agara hogodilla. Traffic jam iratte. This after passenger is boarded and seated . Who gives them right to decide to change stop. The commuter agrees to get down half a km away from the stop and buys ticket.

Overcrowding on some routes is there a Law for safety anywhere ..

 Then each passenger has a nightmare scanning to pay ticket. Every6shouted at rudely to use the small sticker near entrance. Shame on BMTC such behaviour by this conductor is not taken action. If BMTC bus conductor and driver are doing their job with arude behaviour the people boarding bus are doing jobs too. But with a dignifed behavior.  When they stand in AC volvo for 2.5 hours swaying and hanging for 2.5 hours paying same ticket price as those who sit! Shame on you BMTC for pathetic services. 

No wonder  after some point faith of people in public transport wades away. It is not just running number of buses or giving AC buses to ride. Are these two people taught how to ride to make it a comfortable ride for public? 

If not let them not misreat or be rude to people who return after a tiring day! I saw a driver rushing and drving with sidden brakes in KA 57 F-965 in the evening at kundalahalli Metro. 

The sudden brakes so rampant during every stops. A lady , obviously returning from work just got down from seat when her stop came. The sudden brake at her bus stop made her completly fall flat on the floor of the bus.she toppled on 2 other ladies who hit to the walls of the bus. Where is first aid? She was not given a minute to gather herself to get up!. The bus is already starting from the stop and conductor is also looking blank to not even stop the bus a minute more so she can get down comfortably!. She rushed in same state and its a shame volvo buses and the driver and conductors.

Suddenly, my monthly water bill is way higher, and even a small grocery run feels a lot more expensive. 

On top of that, taking an auto in the city has become increasingly frustrating. It’s common to deal with auto drivers refusing short rides, asking for sky-high fares, and no auto during evenings or when it rains. 

All this has made simple everyday tasks like commuting and shopping more stressful and left me constantly calculating how to manage my budget for the month.

1hg2aej,bangalore,My new phone got snatched,"So last Tuesday, I finished my work around 7:30 pm and I was walking in the mahadevapura road near DNR apartments to take metro in Singayyanapalya. The road does not have proper street light and its pretty dark. I got a call so I took my phone (Redmi Note 13 pro, just bought it a week back) out of my pocket and hardly spoke for few seconds. By the time I cut the call and about to put it back in my pocket, a guy in the bike just snatched my phone from my right side. I was shocked for a moment. I started chasing him, I couldn't run fast as I was carrying my laptop bag. There were not many people at the time. The thief seeing me chasing him threw the phone on the road, I picked up the phone but it wasn't mine. It was also stolen phone (Vivo) from someone else. Meanwhile this thief got away. I went to mahadevapura police station and complained about the situation and handed the other phone to them. I didn't notice the number plate. 
Police have taken complaint and blocked the phone in the CEIR portal. It was already switched off.They said only when the phone is turned on and new Sim card is inserted, it can be tracked. Its already been one week and I have lost hope of getting my phone.

1gerzyd,bangalore,Demigods of Bangalore: unreachable doctors and the elitisim of hospitals.,"What is happening with Bangalore hospitals and doctors?
 There is a complete mismatch in the expectation and reality in Bangalore medical field. 
I have observed that the hospitals in Bangalore do not follow the appointment schedule. Though we pay whatever they ask for the appointment, I haven't seen a single appointment met on time in any hospital. 

The waiting period is way tiring and exhausting. Why are they booking so many appointments that they can't serve.

Even the good doctors, I am familiar with are rushing into diagnosis and prescribing tests and medicine to accommodate more appointments.

The hospitals are scheduling appointments every 5 mins and some doctor  is spending 15 mins delaying other appointments. 
 Why are they not understanding how their own doctors work.

We were asked to admit my brother for a test early in the morning to run some tests and we were made to wait till 4:00 PM. Then they informed the doctor is on the way from Tumkur and will reach by 7:00 PM. 

As I experienced in the last 4 years, this has become a common practice for hospital to over commit and under perform. 

I don't know why no authority is concerned about it. Why do they always come after some disaster happen? ",169,62,1730200326,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1gerzyd/demigods_of_bangalore_unreachable_doctors_and_the/

There's societies of Prestige, Sobha, GMI, Salapuria and all those builders in the area streching from Harlur Road to Bellandur to Sarjapur, societies where apartments go for 3 cr for 3BHK now.

There's no access road, the lakes are worse than other places, the roads are fucked and we don't have metro. 

Why is that?! It hit me that this part of Bangalore which is mostly in IT sector pay great taxes, generate most revenues, spend most overfilling the unbelievable amount of pubs in this area & order infinite food circulating money in local Bangalore ecosystem. Yet, the civic infra is not present. 

Because this part does NOT vote. Literally 70% of this area is in Goa during election weekend. Why would anyone care? 

The politicians are in cahoots with builders, they make a bank, they run the pubs, they again make the bank, and they know they don't have to care as they don't vote. 

Have you seen the Kengeri satelite project? That was Sarjapur once. They even got parks and all planned. Because people care, I guess? They vote. 

Harlur road has 20 premium societies with 12 feet road. There are broader road in Malleshwaram with duplex lining either side. 

The IT corridor has become a stupid doormat because they don't belong here or there. And, it's their own doing.

I'm reading a book in Domlur SAARC park with earphones plugged in. 5 mins into reading, I look up as I get a sudden feeling  that someone is staring and it's an old dude in the children's playground (I assumed he was there with his grandchildren). He smiled at me. I smiled back as not to act rude. Then I kept on reading and enjoying my book until around 20 mins later I see the guy coming towards me. I thought he was just walking around. But to my surprise, he sat right next to me. Even when most of the other benches were empty. 

He asked me in Kannada (For context, I'm not from here. And I don't speak much kannada but I can manage.) ""are you reading geeta?"" (even though, my book clearly says stephen king). I said no it's something else. Then he started asking about me (where I'm from, where I stay, how much I make), I kept my answers very short and incorrect (again, so as not to seem rude) and tried my best to show no interest in continuing the conversation. Now, this is where the werid thing happened, he tapped on my thigh (I was wearing running shorts) and asked my age. I contained my anger (I don't like random people touching me) and answered. Then he kept looking straight at me, at this point I was getting very uncomfortable. Minute later, he taps my thigh and again asks if I was reading geeta. I got up and left.

1lbjkxl,bangalore,Need help!! A shady car kept stalking us to our PG in jakkasandra extension,"Please help!!! My girlfriend and I were being stalked by a very shady golden colour Chevrolet optra near jakkasandra extension and it gave us the creeps. This happened when my girlfriend and I went out partying to Chin Lung's in Kormangala, given that our PG is really close(near loco bear)  we decided to walk back instead of taking an auto/cab home around 12 midnight.

 After we crossed D Mart kormangala and got near the juice shop called Natural juice point or something (can't recall the actual name) an old golden colour chevrolet optra started following us. The car was a privately owned vehicle and not a cab.That street is very dimly lit, desolate and we were unable to see where the car was parked initially.

 We ignored the car thinking it was on its way somewhere else and not actually following us, but then it started following us really close, the car was being driven really slow so as to match our walking pace, stopped whenever we stopped, took a turn when we turned right towards our PG and it also got really close to my girlfriend's feet more than once and she was terrified. 

The driver was just wearing a white vest(baniyan) had no shirt on and looked shady, I got a look at the number plate but forgot the number given that I had a few beers.

 We kept walking towards our PG  where we reached in the next 5 minutes. There I stopped to look at the driver and took out my phone as to take a photo of the car, that's when the driver actually sped up took a left towards loco bear and disappeared out of our sight.

My girlfriend was petrified I kept reassuring her that we were safe and driver was probably on his way somewhere else so as to avoid any panic and reach our PG gate where there would be guards and other people around  to help us if things go haywire. I was really confused as to whether it was cops, civilians etc and thought the best course of action was to walk to our PG safely not showing any signs of distress like running etc and then actually deal with the driver. In hindsight me and my girlfriend both know that the driver stalked us with a malicious intent and we avoided a major threat. Looking back at what happened and what we avoided makes our blood run cold. I want to know if anyone else has faced similar situation near jakkasandra extension (loco bear road) and can provide more information about the car/driver or any sort of help/advice. Any response is appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR: Help! Stalked by a shady man wearing a baniyan in his golden colour chevrolet optra car on the road between D Mart kormangala and loco bear.

1gi56w0,bangalore,Connection with stray dog,"Today, on my long walk, I bumped into a stray dog, who, out of nowhere, started walking alongside me. Initially I thought that it was a coincidence that he and I were going the same way, but after a point I realized that he was walking with me. He did not interact with me - no looking at me, no playing with me, no wagging of tail, and most of the times, he either walked ahead of me, or behind me, and would occasionally stop at places, but would catch up with me eventually.

He would cross roads with me, and if we somehow ended up on opposite sides of the road, he would wait for the vehicles to pass so that he could cross to come to the same side as mine. If he went too far ahead of me, he would slow down, and even look back to see if I was there, and then would resume. I also saw him looking for me when he lost sight of me. At some point I thought that he must be looking for food, so I bought and offered him a treat. He did not even look at it. I felt he was wary, and he didn't show any affection unlike other dogs. He just gave me company.

At a point, I had to go to a store. At that time, he was walking ahead of me. So, when he looked back and saw me entering the store, he decided to wait for me outside the store. When I came out from the store, he showed some excitement and leaped towards me, but became normal soon, and continued walking.

We came close to my house when other dogs in my vicinity started barking at him. He stopped and kept looking back at me. I had been trying to make him go because I knew that this would happen, and now was the time I had to let him go. So, I felt emotional and stood there for a bit. With a heavy heart, I resumed walking towards my home hoping he would go away now. But, he tried coming towards me still. But the dogs chased him away. I waited there to see if he safely escaped them. He did. It was late night, so I couldn't do much. Also, I can't adopt him because I am not ready for that responsibility and where I live, pets aren't allowed.

I feel so emotional right now recalling how he gave me company till my home and that I couldn't do anything but let him go.

1mgd5si,bangalore,Please don't abandon your pets,"Saw around 6–8 puppies with their mamma. What caught my attention was the mom had a neckband ...clearly looks like it was a pet or some guard dog once. I was just passing by and noticed them stranded in the middle of nowhere. No people nearby, no food around, nothing.

Born street indies know how to survive. But if the dog has been domesticated since birth, it's super hard for them to survive out there.

Now I’m not some hardcore animal rights person or whatever... in fact I usually don’t even like street dogs much, just being honest. But this one hit different. Even someone like me, heart of rock, felt something. So I ended up adopting one pup (named it Omini), took it to the vet for vaccines and all, and it's now chilling indoors with me.

Enough of the rant ...here's the point:
These pups are insanely cute, active, and healthy. The mother dog looks like a trained guard/hunter dog. Runs like a beast, follows cues, super alert. The pups are genetically strong.

If you’re in Bengaluru and have even a tiny thought of getting a dog... please consider adopting one of these. They’re just out there, waiting. Trust me, they’re low maintenance compared to fancy breeds and cost next to nothing. Plus, you’ll be saving a life.

DM me if you’re serious about adopting. Can share location and help with whatever info I have.

1ib98dd,bangalore,Hit a dog accidentally!,"On 23 January while on my way to the office a dog suddenly came in my way and I accidentally hit him. Nothing happened to me my bike went airborne and landed somehow. The dog ran and fell down on the other side of the road. This shook me and I went to check up on the dog I had no idea what to do in this situation. Called some of my friends and asked their help they told me some hospitals and vets. I rushed home and took a bed-sheet to pick the dog up and got in to the rapido pet auto. When I reached  there the dog was not there and he was running around. Then some people who lives on the road site(in one of those cemented houses that they make in blr duting a house construction) came and said it is their dog and asked what happened i sadi i accidentally hit him and let's take him to the vet
Then i took hum to the vet got him checked up the doc said ever looks fine just look for internal bleeding and gave some medications i paid for all that and then gave the kid who sadi his family owns the dog some money to buy chicken for him.
Next day the guy calls and ask for money for food which i gave him then again he called ain the evening for more money which i also gave. Then next day he calls and sadi give me more money to which i sadi i will get the food(chicken) deliverd to your house and did it then next day the guy called and said give me 1500 and I will take Care of the dog and leave you. I gave him 1500 rs and told him to send the gos video eating food and all. Now next day he calls me and asked for 2500 and said the dog will die and they will come for me blah blah and he is taking the dog to his village so I argued a bit but then gave the money to him (i was just thinking the poor dog should not die . That dog looked at me in the hospital that day in such a sad helpless way) then he calls again and said 2500 more as the dog is very badly hurt and the doc is asking for that much money to which i said stop lying and all but after a while i gave the money as the guy actually looked like he cares about his dog and i felt responsible for it. Then he calls me again and said just 3k more rupees and the dog will be completely fine to which i got angry and asked him to stop calling me this went on for a while but again i gave the 3k so in total 8k plus all the food I bought and the hospital bill for the first day in total I have spent 10k now. Now today morning he called me and said the doc sadi that dog is fine and he will be okay. Then he said (bhaiya apni khushi se kuch paisa dedo) meaning now he is just asking money for himself and i got angry and stopped picking up his calls. Now in the evening he called me again and said give 500 rs for food for the dog to which i said the dog is okay please feed him whatever you used to feed him before all this happened and then we argued a bit and i cut the call. Now he is kinda scaring me saying i know your photo i have your number i will go tell police. So i said please go to the police and let them take care of this(to which he kinda stuttered and said why, i am guessing he lied a lot in these 2-3 days and just wanted money from me) now if he really cares about the dog and did everything he said i told him please go put one FIR on me as I already called my bike insurance company and the guy told me to do so(they said on the basis on the calculations the company will reimburse the money to the owners).

Now what can I do, I really want this to be over
It was not my fault the dog came in front of me accidentally the owners didn't have a leash on him. Have you guys ever faced something like this? What steps should i take now.
It feels like being a good hearted person is the worst thing today if it was someone else that day they would have left the dog to die there but to me it just felt morally wrong and i could not leave the poor puppy to die.

1gs3w0p,bangalore,"Dear Bangalore, you have been great at accepting us North Indians. But, what is North India according to you?","When I moved to Bangalore, I didn’t know what to expect. Everything felt so new—the language, the food, and the culture. But over time, the city welcomed me with open arms, and now it feels like home.

One thing I’ve noticed, recently, is that people often refer to us all as ""North Indians"" like we’re one big group. But North India is not just one place—it’s a mix of so many states, cultures, and traditions. Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and so many others—each one is unique.

We’ve all brought something special to Bangalore. From the food stalls serving chhole bhature to startups run by hardworking North Indian founders, we’ve added our own flavor to the city. And in return, Bangalore has given us opportunities and a sense of belonging.

After the pandemic, many of us were working from home and thought it might stay that way. But due to pressure from some politicians, companies had to bring employees back to offices in Bangalore. It wasn’t easy for many of us to pack up and move again, but we did it because this city is more than just a workplace—it’s where we’ve built lives and friendships.

Bangalore wouldn’t be what it is today without people from all parts of India working together. It’s a melting pot, and that’s what makes it so special.",0,73,1731697317,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1gs3w0p/dear_bangalore_you_have_been_great_at_accepting/
1f9itl4,bangalore,Some words for Namma Bengaluru,"I had shifted to Bengaluru city in 2005, soon after completing my graduation from Pune.

It was Bangalore then, daily bus pass would cost Rs. 18 and I believe auto people had just started asking for Rs. 10 extra (claiming, they wouldn’t get any other passenger after dropping first one), full plate of gobi Manchurian was Rs. 10 and full tandoor chicken at Al-bek hotel (Malleswaram) was Rs. 80. So, you spend Rs. 50 for a nice dinner (half plate tandoor for Rs. 40 and 10 for Pepsi). The weather was so pleasant that we didn’t buy a ceiling fan up till May 2006. Few people were grumbling on metro construction, since many trees had to be cut.

I didn’t like the city in beginning, perhaps because I always used to compare Bengaluru with Pune. I had so many complains back then about city like, language barrier, no eateries opened till mid-night. But then very soon, I started taking pride staying in Bengaluru. And, it became “Namma Bengaluru” for me. I started enjoying the wonderful weather of Bengaluru.

I stayed for 3 nights in Kumaraswamy Layout, 1 month in Ramaiah Nagar, 2 years in Prakash Nagar (Dr. Rajkumar Road), 5 years in Azad Nagar (Chamraj Pet), 1 year in BTM Layout and 5 years at JP Nagar 7^(th) Phase. I had taken admission in Ganga Kaveri college, Dr. Rajkumar Road and that’s where I got to know about Karnataka, Kannadigas, Bangaluru, Mysore, Kaveri water issue, Mahadayi water issue, Dr. Rajkumar and family, Brijesh Patel (cricketer in first world cup squad in 1975), Ramakrishna Hegde and S. M. Krishna (ex chief minister of Karnataka; I had read earlier about SM Krishna’s role in bringing MNCs to Karnataka).

My day would normally start with reading BT (Bangalore Times) followed by having banana+tea near college. I made a point to try local cuisines gobi manchurian, dahi-puri, dilpasand, rawa idly.

I was wondering as to what’s the meaning of “Hodi Maga” and that took me watch first Kannada movie Jogi in Navrang theater, along with 3 wonderful Kannadigas. Movie started and I see few people crying, movie ended, and I am finding it difficult to hold my tears. The craziness for Jogi movie was so much that one person in my neighborhood opted for the same hair style, as that of Dr. Shiva Rajkumar.

In same year, Dr. Rajkumar passed away and I saw many people crying inconsolably. Few of my friends had walked to Sree Kanteerava Stadium to attend last rites of Dr. Rajkumar.

In 2006 “Mungaru Male” was released and I witnessed people basking in song “Anisuthide yaako indu”, few people were also blaming director Yogaraj Bhat for the tragic end. The political circle were all abuzz, since, JDS had formed alliance with BJP and H. D. Kumaraswamy became chief minister. Newspaper first page would cover how Nitte Santosh Hegde Sir (retired Supreme Court Judge), as state Lokayukta was putting all efforts to get state rid-off corrupt people.

People who used to travel by flights, were all praise for Captain Gopinath Sir (Captain Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar Gopinath) for introducing low cost airline, “Deccan Airlines”.

 In 2010 Hosur Road flyover was built and that reduced travel time from Electronic City to Silk Board by 21 minutes (from 30 to 9).

I was so heart broken when the news of V. G. Siddhartha (CCD- Café Coffee Day) death broke out (2019), after all I had many coffees at CCD outlet. The pain was bit relieved when came to know that Malavika Krishna is reviving CCD again.

I really believe these are people from Bengaluru who make this city awesome.

Below I have listed some wonderful memories (many “First” ones) while being in Bengaluru.

2005- Shifted to Bengaluru, watched first regional language movie in theater (Jogi at Navrang theater). Later, watched many Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam movies. On a lighter note, I was ahead of many people to understand what amazing movies are made in Sandalwood, Kollywood, Tollywood and Mollywood.

2007- Completed M.Sc. Biotechnology, first job at a pharma company in Electronic City, first bank account (HDFC), first costly sports shoe (Nike).

2008- Got Pan card, first increment at job, first flight journey (Bengaluru to Delhi), first AC train journey

2009- Got passport and first abroad trip

2010- First promotion at job

2011- First bike (Hero Honda Passion Pro)

2013- Got Aadhar card

2014- First house booking (near electronic city)

2018- Moved to another city, however, curd-rice continues to be an indispensable part of my diet plan. Yes, had to replace Nandini ghee with other brand, due to former’s unavailability locally.

 So, here I am with so many wonderful memories while being in the city and that’s

 So, that’s how “Namma Bengaluru” is special to me.

One suggestion for all those who recently shifted to Bengaluru or planning to, please interact more with local people and learn more about city. And please post small write-up or video highlighting what you liked about the city.

 Cheers!

1hua5bs,bangalore,Bangalore as the City to Settle vs Mumbai: Opinions?,"Hi people, before coming to the question to know your views, just some context. I am unmarried right now and living with family in Mumbai. Have lived in Bangalore for some years, recently moved to Mumbai. I already knew some pros and cons of both the cities before moving, after moving they became bit more clear. I will list some of them, but majorly want to know if others have been in similar situations and if they chose blr. One important note before starting, I am not from either of the two places. I am from a Hindi belt tier 2 city. Also, I work in a good job so kind of in a priveleged position. I can spend money to a good extent on the housing and other expenses, but who doesn't mind getting a 3bhk at the cost of a 2bhk in another city for example. 

Pros of Blr vs Mumbai:
1. Real estate much cheaper. Rents definitely already hurt more here. But I am already worried about paying 4Cr for a house here later on vs in comparison to staying in Blr and getting a similar one for 2Cr perhaps. 
2. Weather is much better. Hands down every body knows this
3. AQI is lot lower. As someone who often falls sick due to air quality, this is a big plus. Also in the long run I think this will add up a lot. If someone isn't aware recently Mumbai AQI was as high as 350 in some areas. 
4. Due to comparatively cheaper real estate, things are bigger and better. You have badminton courts all over, breweries and restaurants are huge. It just feels good to visit those vs cramped up places in Mumbai where you can smell the food of the next table. 
5. Public transport is lot better for someone who is slightly more priveleged like me. I know Mumbai local is a lifeline etc. But let's be realistic I wouldn't ever take it. It's not convenient being sandwiched between people, let alone the safety issues. Blr public transport while lower connectivity and infra, thanks to lot lesser pressure of crowd is comparatively much more comfortable- both metro and the AC buses. 
6. I like the Blr crowd better, most are engineers like me, are from corporate. That feeling of relatibility is completely missing for me in Mumbai. 

Cons of Blr vs Mumbai:
1. I rarely get told that I am an outsider or made to feel so. In Blr from auto walas to shop keepers to even property managers it's a hassle. I minimise my interaction with such people, but can't do away with that completely. Also the one off incidents that happen on the Sarjapur road scare me. 
2. The traffic is shit. While Mumbai traffic is also very bad, in Mumbai you know that you will reach. It's a slow but always moving traffic. In Blr that is so not the case. There can be a stand still for 30 mins at times. 
3. Lack of autos and cabs. You can't be dependent on them ever. You can potentially not get them for hours when you need them. 
4. Water crisis. I don't know how things will pan out. But in the last summer we faced water crisis. I am unsure how this might impact lives moving on. 
5. Language barrier. I am not able to converse in Kannada yet. I try to pick it up but barely successful so far. But mostly able to get away with hindi and english combo. But for older people who only speak Hindi and mother tongue(which isn't Kannada) there is issue interacting with people, especially maids. 

All in all, not sure if it's apparent, I like Blr a lot more. Possibly due to the homely feeling having lived there for a few years. But I feel like my job opportunities are a lot more in Mumbai vs Blr, in the sector that I work in. As such if I move to Blr I will probably be compromising on my career to some extent. But I don't know if it is a wise decision to let the career take a little hit and move to Blr instead given the above positives and negatives that I see. 


Have any of you made a call in a similar situation? Would love to know your views. Also what do you recommend and is there anything that I am missing. 

Will also love to see some points in favour of Mumbai vs Blr if that can help me convince myself to like Mumbai well enough to settle.",25,55,1736092900,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1hua5bs/bangalore_as_the_city_to_settle_vs_mumbai_opinions/
1hz02qo,bangalore,When Street foods are so expensive ? Irrespective of Area in Bengaluru ,"What the hell happening with Street food vendors to price their menu at a damn expensive rates 

Like few years back it was nominal and mostly depended on the Quality and Area where it was operating.

Now shops even at non main roads and interior streets are selling at exorbitant prices.

1. They don't provide Quality Foods
2. They operate at small location mostly without dining So rent shouldn't be a factor 
3. Mostly run by a Native owner with cooks and labour from north , so even shops advertising native food types  like Nati Mane/Mysore based / North Karnataka food & Snacks doesn't feel the actual taste and Sub par

There are now many reason to avoid street food and Walk in into a Restaurant or a Bakery with Neat Ambience considering the value for money they provide.

We left the place immediately booking auto ride from Uber and Rapido, and were in complete shock state due to his abuse that too women, senior citizen and kid, later we noticed that horrible problem with Ola maps, that the location gets detected at two different places, one where, it actually is and one in some mall where it is not there. It was complete TRAUMATIZING feeling, and made us extremely UNSAFE during the ride. Ola has deteriorated in quality, pathetic cabs, rowdy drivers, unsafe feeling, no customer support phone number.

- What’s the least dramatic way to say “I’d like to survive this without being helicoptered out”?

1lqqi0r,bangalore,"⚠️ SCAM ALERT: Fake VC Bangalore based “Sridhar Arunagiri” (aka 16VC, RI5E, Famwork) dupes students, founders & interns","(Scroll imgr link till end, screenshots of how he kept changing his details over the time) 


Hi everyone,

I'm posting this to alert students, job seekers, founders, and investors about an ongoing scam involving a man named Sridhar Arunagiri, who falsely claims to be a global venture capitalist, startup backer, and founder of 16VC, Famwork, and RI5E.

What makes this particularly alarming is that he targets educated, ambitious people from top institutes like BITS Pilani, and charges them money for fake jobs, visas, and startup programs.


---

🧨 Here’s a clear breakdown of his actions — one by one:

1. 🎓 Scammed 25+ BITS Hyderabad students

He charged ₹52,000 per student, promising jobs abroad and visa processing. Two students filed police complaints (FIRs). Many others are still in shock or unsure how to proceed.
📸 Proof album: https://imgur.com/a/aqTtynt
📸 More screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/TIuwHa6

2. 💼 Claims to run a fake VC firm “16VC”

He markets 16VC as a global VC, but it’s not registered with SEBI in India or the SEC in the US—which is a legal requirement for any legit investment firm.
Website: https://www.16vc.co

3. 🌎 Pretends to have global offices

He claims to operate from Berlin, Bengaluru, and Cayman Islands, but all his addresses are just shared WeWork desks, not real offices.

4. 🧠 Fakes academic and professional background

He portrays himself as a graduate from top global schools. Cross-verification shows he never studied abroad, and many of the companies he ""worked with"" do not exist.

5. 🌐 Fake startup portfolio

The “startups” listed under 16VC are AI-generated websites, built using tools like Framer. No real team, no operations, and no incorporation.
Example: https://bankiy.framer.ai

6. 💸 Collects multiple payments for fake services

₹25,000 for random “workshops”

₹52,000 for job placement

₹92,000 for EU Blue Card visa processing

₹90,000 more after FIRs (as ""legal follow-up"")

₹2,00,000 to join a “YC-style accelerator” that doesn’t exist


7. 📢 Posts unpaid job openings to lure interns

He advertises unpaid roles with intense expectations—weekend work, 3 AM messages—until “you prove yourself.”
Example: Google “Bengaluru unpaid internship Sridhar 16VC” to see coverage in major news outlets like Hindustan Times & Economic Times.

8. 🤐 Uses burner accounts & fake profiles

He runs multiple accounts under 16VC, RI5E, and Famwork to like/comment on his own posts, creating a fake sense of legitimacy. He also sends bogus legal notices to silence whistleblowers.

9. 💬 Victims include unpaid interns and staff

At least one contractor has publicly said they were not paid for two months. Dozens of interns have said the same privately.

10. 🚪 No business registered anywhere

None of the entities he operates—16VC, Famwork, RI5E—are legally registered as VC firms or businesses. His only registered entity, Famwork, has been struck off.


---

⚠️ Red Flags to Watch For:

Upfront payments for jobs, visas, or mentorship

“Global VC” with no registration on SEBI or SEC databases

Fake startup websites, fake testimonials

Excessive urgency, FOMO tactics, or guilt-tripping

No real office—just a shared desk

No founders, mentors, or network behind the scenes



---

🛡️ What You Can Do:

Report to local cybercrime or police (FIR recommended)

Report scams to SEBI (India) at https://scores.gov.in

Cross-verify any company’s legitimacy at https://www.sebi.gov.in and https://www.mca.gov.in

Never pay upfront for jobs, visas, or accelerator programs

Warn your college placement cells and peer networks

Share this post to protect others

Please be careful out there. If you’re a student, recent grad, or early-stage founder, don’t fall for the glossy websites, global lingo, or friendly DMs. Always verify.

Let’s make sure this guy doesn’t scam anyone else. 🙏

I request mods to approve this post.  
I came across a post about a tragic accident on BTM Layout, Ring Road, which appears to be a hit-and-run. The crash involved an over speeding Range Rover Defender, which tragically resulted in the death of the two-wheeler rider on the spot. I’m sharing this because I'm a responsible citizen and the person that caused the death should face the consequences. I still don't see any news about this incident online and I hope to do my part by sharing it with people. The police is not helping in filing the case or fetching the cctv recordings of the incident. I just wish the family of the person that has died and the person himself get justice.

1k4nfbg,bangalore,Made my own Bengaluru Metro map!!,"As the title suggests, I created my own version of the [Bangalore metro and suburban rail map](https://pdfhost.io/v/4wVGJXtmg7_BLR_Metro-4) in the style of Harry Beck, the original creator of the Modern London Underground Map. I absolutely love the modern version of the map. I made this map because I was bored and thought it could be presented better than the ones available online. I also enjoyed Footy200’s take, but I felt it was too plain with just vertical and horizontal lines, which moved too far from reality, and a bit confusing interchange station symbols. Which is the point of Beck’s map as once you are the train(underground) it doesn’t matter. But what those maps have, is the river Thames.

While my rendition is not spatially accurate as well, I believe I’ve balanced a bit more towards geographical accuracy because, apart from roads (where most of the metro is aligned), Bangalore doesn’t have any other recognisable features that span the city. For example, the ORR is instantly recognisable and easy to place relative to it. I deliberately made it as close as possible to a ring, but lines aren’t actually in a one big circle. Honestly saddens me as it could have literally been the Ring line, like London’s circle line, even is that is shaped like a bottle!

Some things I’ve kept in mind:

* Only circles/ovals for interchanges
* Only straight/45deg lines. Except ORR lines

1mvatm1,bangalore,Please be extremely cautious while entering Old airport road underpass (for two wheelers),"Actually, its more like ride extremely cautiously when you come back to BLR after a vacation. Why? Because new potholes would have materialized while you were away.

Went to drop a friend at a bus stand the other day and would have almost come under the wheels of a car/bigger vehicle.

Thing is, he was running extremely late to catch his bus and I had no other option but to step on it. It was during the dark hours of the morning around 5 or so and we were on my activa. It was just the previous night where I had come back to the city after a long break, and dumb me thought he knows exactly where all the potholes and bad stretches are....so lets rip and reach there on time? right? Wrong! A deep pothole has developed on the left side just before the underpass begins in the domlur direction while coming from whitefield/Marathahalli. Literally went over it on its left side which made the bike wobble violently. If not for last minute reflexes, we would have ended up right at its deepest point where we would have been destabilized and thrown on the road.

Lighting was also pretty much absent or very low at that time, and my vision was already blurry because I hadn't slept properly the previous night.

1m428e3,bangalore,"Bengaluru, Are We Letting Our Own Voice Go Silent?","Push aside the shiny “Silicon Valley of India” labels for a second. Listen.  
Do you still hear real Bengaluru Kannada in the cafés of Indiranagar?  
Do you still catch strains of Tulu in the fish markets, Kodava in the hockey grounds, Konkani in the old Catholic pockets, Soliga songs in the forest-fringe villages?

Or is it just “Bro,” “Dude,” and PowerPoint English everywhere now, maybe a dash of Bollywood Hindi for reach?

Once upon a time this city rang with:

• Namma Bengaluru Kannada: maga, sakkat, yen guru? a dialect with its own swagger.  
• Tulu lullabies from Mangaluru migrants who built half the darshinis you eat at.  
• Kodava war chants that echoed on parade grounds.  
• Konkani hymns in Fraser Town churches, Beary bazaar calls in Shivajinagar, Lambani folk tales on the outskirts.

Languages with soul, history, recipes, swear words, lullabies.

Today?

You dismiss them as just dialects.  
You grin, Kannada baralla, boss.  
You put proficient in English, Hindi on your resume and feel modern.  
You let your child’s international school fine them for speaking the local tongue.  
Avenue Road boards flip to glossy Latin script. Metro announcements bend toward Hindi-English first, Kannada last, sometimes not at all.

And no one even forced us. We complied quietly, politely, like good cosmopolitans.

Is that what we call progress?  
One tongue dropping out of conversation after another until the city that once coined the name Benda-kaalu-ooru can’t pronounce it without Google?

Ask yourself:

• How much longer before your ajji’s bedtime story becomes just noise to your own kids?  
• When was the last time you wrote a WhatsApp message in actual Kannada script instead of half-baked Latin phonetics?  
• What happens to a city’s memory when its mother sounds disappear?

No, you don’t have to single-handedly “save” every dialect. But stop acting like they don’t matter.

Speak it at home. Teach one proverb to your kids. Order coffee in the language of the land. Insist that schools run at least one true Kannada period a day. Respect the auto driver who refuses English not because he’s stubborn but because that’s his birthright.

Once a tongue goes quiet in its own birthplace, it’s gone for good. Silicon Valley salaries and Third Wave coffee won’t bring it back.

1m3q88e,bangalore,Professionally Scammed by Service Centre,"Can you believe this absolute nightmare? I have this Samsung washing machine, just three years old, and out of nowhere, it decides to stop working on July 12th, throwing some random error. So, I Google the Samsung service centre number. I call, and some lady at a call centre answers. Now, usually, these call centres have this whole script they follow, right? But not this time. It was like talking to someone who had no clue what they were doing. I asked if they were an authorised service centre, and she assured me they were, based in Whitefield. She wanted my model number, an image of the product, and my location. 

The next day, a technician shows up. He inspects the machine and says there’s a problem with the board that needs checking. He takes off the top cover, removes the board, and tells me an engineer will call after analysing it. He asks for a ₹350 consultation fee, and I pay it, thinking it’s all good.

Then, on July 14th, the service centre lady calls and says the board needs resetting and a component replacement, costing around ₹7,000. My machine’s out of warranty, so I have no choice but to agree. On July 16th, the same technician comes back, fixes the board, runs a spin cycle, and says everything’s fine. He hands me an invoice for ₹7,380, and I pay, relieved that it’s working again.

But wait, it gets worse! Five minutes after he leaves, the machine stops working again. I call him, and he says he’ll be there in 30 minutes. I wait, but no one shows up. I call multiple times, but the phone just rings. I call the service centre, and the same lady says not to worry, they’ll send someone tomorrow.

On July 17th, I call again, and she says a technician will be there by 2:00 pm. Time passes, and she updates me to 4:00 pm. Nothing. I call again for 7:00 pm, and still, no one comes. I’m calling the technician non-stop, but he never picks up.

By July 18th, I’m calling both the service centre and the technician, but no response. I call over 20 times, and then, in the evening, my number gets blocked. I try from another number, but still, no luck. It’s clear now—this is a scam!

I start digging into the details. The invoice is a complete joke. My name is wrong, there’s no GST number, the phone number doesn’t work, and my address is incorrect. I finally get the real Samsung customer care number from the user manual and call them. That’s when I realise I’ve been scammed big time. I admit, it was my mistake for not being more cautious. I never thought such professional scammers existed.

Total loss: ₹8,000. 

Lesson learned: Always dial the right number, stick to authorised service centres, ask for a service request number, and verify all details. Be on the lookout for scammers everywhere!

1fsrdsv,bangalore,Another Flipkart Delivery Scam,"As many of you know, the Big Billion Days sale is in full swing, and recently, I came across a Reddit post where someone shared a troubling story about a delivery guy trying to scam him. Unfortunately, I had a similar experience that I'd like to share.

I was expecting my new iPhone-15 to be delivered, along with an exchange of my old iPhone 11. When the delivery guy arrived and began the product quality check, he claimed to see a ""yellow tan"" on my screen. My iPhone 11 is just two years old and in perfect condition so I couldn’t see any issues. However, he started threatening that if he failed the screen quality test, I’d have to pay ₹3,000 to Flipkart. He then suggested that he could pass all the checks if I paid him ₹500 directly.

I refused to pay the amount, but he made a call to someone else, who also started pressuring me saying they couldn’t pass the screen check unless I paid. After a long back-and-forth, and because I was running late for a meeting, I ended up paying ₹500 for issues like a missing box and charging cable.I could not record the entire discussion as I was alone with no other phone and was getting late for the office.

I’m not sure if Flipkart is aware of what’s going on, but it feels like their delivery partners are acting more like goons and extortionists these days.",113,41,1727688151,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1fsrdsv/another_flipkart_delivery_scam/

I’ve been trying to submit an e-Property application for two flats in **Doddanekundi hoodi**  — and I keep running into this technical error that says:

***“The registered deed number is already submitted/approved for a different application.”***

To fix this, I went to the **BBMP office in Hoodi** (near Phoenix Marketcity ) and filed a formal complaint on **July  2025**, along with all required documents — tax receipts, khata certificates, everything.

I even took it a step further and emailed the **BBMP Commissioner directly**. The email was acknowledged, and I really thought things would finally move forward.

But here’s the weird part: after talking to a BBMP official, I found out that **this kind of issue can only be resolved through a backend correction by the case worker**, something they have access to. Instead, I was told the issue was “forwarded to the head office,” which — as it turns out — **isn’t even part of the actual process.**

To make things worse, when I **called the official again to follow up**, I was told flat out that **there’s no deadline or timeline** for when it will be resolved.

So, what’s the point of escalating to the top if the local staff just ignore the process and delay everything?

It’s been weeks now and still no update, no progress, nothing. I’m doing everything by the book, but it feels like we’re just stuck in a loop of passing the buck.

1gb5lzo,bangalore," Horrible Experience with Kidney Stone Treatment at Manipal Hospital Varthur – Misdiagnosis, Delayed Care, and Negligence**","Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent nightmare of an experience at Manipal Hospital with how my kidney stone treatment was handled. I underwent the RT RIRS surgery to remove a 5.5 mm stone. I hope this helps others be more cautious and aware when dealing with medical advice. I’ll try to keep it as concise as possible, but it’s been a long and frustrating journey.

\---

\*\*The Timeline:\*\*

\*\*1. 14th Sep: Visit to the Emergency Room\*\*

I went to the ER with extreme pain due to a kidney stone. After the initial pain relief, they told me to consult a urologist. I met Dr. X, who advised a CT scan. When the scan came back, he vaguely said the stone was “very big,” without actually specifying the size. Later, when I saw the UT scan report, it said the stone was about 4.5 to 5.5 mm. I have a history of passing stones this size naturally, but I felt pressured into surgery(RT RIRS)  without any alternatives being explained to me. They knew I had insurance and asked me to get all pre approvals and get surgery done the next working day. 

\*\*2. 16th Sep: RT RIRS Surgery\*\*

I went ahead with the surgery. Dr. X told me I could go back to all my normal physical activities (gym, sports, etc.) right after. But here’s the kicker: when I saw the dietician afterward, she actually laughed at that advice and said I needed to be careful for the next few weeks! I was so confused and felt totally misinformed. For the next few days, I was extremely lethargic but started feeling better after 3-4 days.

\*\*3. 30th Sep: Sudden High Fever\*\*

I started running a fever of 102°F with no other symptoms. I contacted Dr. X's assistant, G, as I suspected it was due to the stent. G dismissed this and didn’t take it seriously. I even went to see Dr. X on 1st Oct, but he brushed off my concerns, saying the stent couldn’t be causing the fever. By this point, my fever was consistently 103-104°F, and I was miserable.

\*\*4. 1st-2nd Oct: Misdiagnosis and Delayed Tests\*\*

They referred me to Dr. Y, who was about to go on leave the next day (great timing, right?). She ordered a bunch of tests – CRP, CBC, Typhoid, Dengue – but didn’t even include a Kidney Function Test (KFT). By 2nd Oct, my CRP levels were sky-high at 190, and I was still in a horrible state. Meanwhile, G kept saying it was typhoid and that I needed to be admitted – which was completely wrong.

\*\*5. 2nd-4th Oct: Finally, the Stent Is Removed\*\*

I couldn’t take the pain and trauma anymore, so I went back to the emergency room on 2nd Oct. This time, the duty doctor immediately ordered a KFT, which showed high creatinine levels (a major red flag that should have been noticed days earlier!). Despite all this, they still kept thinking it was some viral infection, and it took until 4th Oct for them to finally remove the DJ stent, which immediately made me feel better.

\*\*6. In-Hospital Care: Horrendous\*\*

Throughout my hospital stay, the nurses were super unresponsive and lacked any kind of personal care. I had severe neck pain due to improper head posture, which I’d been complaining about since day one of my admission. Despite raising it with Dr. Z, no one took it seriously until I insisted on seeing a physiotherapist. To top it off, there was no duty doctor on the night of 4th Oct when I was in terrible pain. I had to wait until the morning to get any pain relief! 

  
After this ordeal , I had lost around 9% body weight, took me 2 weeks to recover and sick off from office. And many more months to completely recover and get back to my normal day to day physical activities like Gym, Tennis, running etc",147,32,1729784348,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1gb5lzo/horrible_experience_with_kidney_stone_treatment/

1kwu9b1,mumbai,Why is Mumbai run from Mantralaya and not by the people who live in it?,"Why your elected ward councillor can’t fix basic issues like drainage, garbage, or street repairs? It’s not just laziness — it’s because they don’t actually have the power to get things done.

**1. Local bodies were meant to be powerful — but the State keeps control.**

The **73rd & 74th Constitutional Amendments** were supposed to give real powers to Panchayats and Municipalities over local matters.
But there’s a loophole: the Constitution says states ""may"" give these powers — not ""shall"". So Maharashtra (like many states) **chooses not** to fully devolve power to local bodies. The result? Power stays with the state government and its appointed bureaucrats.

**2. Councillors are elected — but the power lies elsewhere.**

Your local ward councillor (corporator) is elected by you — but they can’t approve budgets, hire staff, or even get a drain cleaned without BMC’s administrative go-ahead.
Instead, real authority lies with the **Municipal Commissioner, an IAS officer** and state-run bodies like **MMRDA**. (give your regards to Bhushan Gagrani on X/Twitter)
If councillors actually had power:
People would know whom to hold accountable. We’d know which office to go to for real help. And we could vote them out if they failed.
Right now, there’s no clear link between your vote and results — and that’s by design.

**3. Who’s to blame — and why BMC elections are still pending.**

The **Maharashtra State Government** controls when local elections happen and how much power local bodies get.
BMC elections have been delayed — and under Section 36 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949, the state can extend the corporation’s term in “extraordinary circumstances.”
But let’s be clear: even if elections are held, without giving real power to elected councillors, nothing will change on the ground.

If you want better roads, cleaner streets, and faster services, you need:
Real **power and accountability** of Urban Local Bodies a.k.a BMC.

1mv7zq2,mumbai,Cleaning help stole my AirPods,"My cleaning help stole my AirPods and now I feel bad about what happened

So this weird situation happened and I can’t stop thinking about it.

A few days ago, when I was heading to the gym, I couldn’t find my AirPods. I hadn’t gone out anywhere and I usually keep my stuff in place, so it was strange they were missing.

I checked the location and it showed up in a lane opposite my building where the Urban Company office is (my help came through UC, and since she was good at her work, we kept her on separately).

We didn’t want to assume the worst, so we decided to just check. Coincidentally, this was the same time she came to our building. When we went downstairs, we saw her at the main gate… wearing my AirPods.

We confronted her and she immediately tried to cover them with her dupatta, denied they were mine, and even tried to run away. Because it was right at the gate with guards and traffic, she couldn’t. Eventually, she handed them back.

The next day, she told us that she “didn’t steal them” and that they “fell into her pocket while cleaning”… which makes no sense at all.

I didn't complain about her but since this all happened in front of the guards, they reported it, and now they’re not letting her into the building anymore. That’s basically where her UC work is, so she’s lost her main source of jobs (atleast here). 
Now here’s the part messing with me, I feel bad. I don’t like being lied to, but at the same time I feel guilty that she’s lost her work because of this. She’ll probably get other buildings to work in, but the whole thing is sitting heavy on me. I also kind of believe in ill wishes, and this whole situation feels bad. 

What should I do? 😔

1mqn5u5,mumbai,My local train turned into a moving festival yesterday,"Yesterday I was on a local train from Dadar to Borivali, and honestly, I didn’t expect anything special just another crowded ride. But in that one hour, the train became a whole celebration.

First, some people started singing patriotic songs for Independence Day. Slowly, more people joined in, clapping and smiling. Then they began celebrating Dahi Handi for Krishna Janmashtami singing Krishna bhajans with so much joy and just when I thought it would end, someone started doing garba… and then the whole compartment joined! Imagine dancing and singing while the train is running, everyone laughing like old friends.
For that one hour, we weren’t strangers in a train we were part of the same celebration. I got down at Borivali still smiling.",2748,322,1755231191,https://v.redd.it/ixnr0qadz3jf1
1ikn9j0,mumbai,The Fading Echo of the Mumbai's train platform Shoe Shine Boys,"I was at the railway station recently when I noticed something that stuck with me. The shoe shine boys—except they weren’t boys at all. Most of them were middle-aged men, sitting quietly beside their wooden boxes, waiting. But what struck me the most was the silence.

I remember a time when their tap-tap—the sound of brushes knocking against the footrest—would echo through the station, a subtle call to travelers in polished leather shoes. But now? That sound is almost gone. The younger crowd walks past in sneakers, canvas shoes, and slip-ons. No shine needed. No business for them.

I watched as they sat there, some still glancing up when someone in formal shoes passed by, but most just staring into the distance. It made me wonder—what happens when your skill, once in demand, no longer has a place? These men aren’t just losing customers; they’re losing their craft, their daily bread, their dignity.

I don’t know what the solution is, but I do know this—if you ever find yourself at a station wearing leather shoes, maybe stop for a shine. Not because you need it, but because they do. Maybe in that moment, we can bring back the tap-tap, if only for a little while.

1kutyle,mumbai,Avoid Inox R-city. Traumatizing Experience.,"Went for a late night Mission Impossible show yesterday at Inox R-city in Ghatkopar. Show didn't start for 40 mins from schedule time. Till then the Cinema guys kept on saying it will start in 5 mins, every time asked. 
Around 11.30 (for a 10.50 show) they came and said we can't play the movie due to some technical issues with the movie KDM (reel). When probed it was clear that issue was not with movie but they didn't have any operator to run the projection as even advertisements were not played which have a separate KDM. There were oldies, couples with babies, and around 50 ppl waiting for 40-45 mins on a dead screen. 
The manager simply came and asked ppl to go home and ask refund from booking website. Some ppl requested to cancel their popcorn orders but he rudely said that you can take your popcorns and carry them home. This triggered ppl and they started asking for refund on the spot. One old aunty who came from far got really furious on the stupid and arrogant Manager. Recommend to avoid Inox R-city for any movie plans.. ",2993,238,1748146823,https://v.redd.it/7yuy2q6xtu2f1

1h6np2y,mumbai,Hurt by the least expected person ,"My bestfriend is getting married soon. Wedding functions and festivities have started. He has been my bestfriend since childhood. And now he has not even invited me to his wedding festivities, only for wedding and that also because he needs another car in case of need for baarat and relatives. His other friends were invited and are invited in all functions big or small. I met him a couple of days back and he didn't even mention any of the functions happening. 
We have been bestfriends since 20years plus. And I don't even know how to comprehend this. I feel betrayed and hurt. 
Got hurt by a friend, i never expected.

Edit. UPDATE!!!

I attended the wedding. 
I was the first friend to reach to his place, helped with all the arrangements, did pick-ups for all his relatives, looked after him. He asked me to bring my car, bcs I didn't take it. I brought my car then, though conflicted... Took him, another friend of his and his brothers, went to Venue 1. Helped him out over there, as he had a very long photoshoot there... I was completely occupied with coordination, arrangements, providing locations, other things through the whole time. His group of friends turned up quite later, I was juggling everything being the point of contact with Event Mgmt, bride's family, grooms family and plenty of other guests and friends. The friends were there only for Instagramable photos and videos of them, the groom and them and the bride and them.

We were late for the baarat, rushed him, looked after all his valuables and stuff needed for the wedding ceremonies. Reached almost in time for Baarat. 
Let me tell you, Baarat was dull AF. I quite literally was feeling so bad... There was no energy, no excitement. I jumped in with all energy to bring the vibe, pulled his cousins, older relatives, friends and danced like anything. It was so good to see him Happy. He smiled the first time through the whole day till then. I was by his side from the early morning. All the ceremonies for entry and other things happened. Then there was the dream romantic moment "" Varmala "".

We head inside to proceed with other ceremony and pooja. I was handling multiple things, catering, maharaj, seating, event mgmt, valuables, gifts, etc. The couple was drained bcs of the heat and constant ceremonies without any break. They requested for refreshments multiple times to the group of friends who were with them when they were seated for the ceremonies, while I was running to get people, parents, uncle aunties needed for Poojas and handling catering to get it ready for lunch as guests started to flow in. The couple's need wasn't even heard by this group. When I came to them to update on certain things, they were literally looking half dead snd and were like kuch bhi leke aa khane please. I was so angry at that point, ki kya chutiye log hai ( their friends), couldn't they just signal a waiter and ask for refreshments. I arranged for a full time waitress near the bride, made 4 people guard 2 access paths to the couple as people were walking and standing in between and blocking their view and disrupting flow of people's movement. 
Then comes the joota churai and pheras, I was his anwar and was right with him all the time. Made him and bride laugh, we got great pictures. The pheras was a Bang! So much fun, enjoyed so much, we were actually dancing between the pheras, as the bride had selected a playlist to play specifically and the families were performing. There was a moment after phera, where I almost was caught in cross fire by multiple cousins of the bride who tried to steal the joota from me😂. They failed. I was dragging 7 people... Kinda felt like Sunny Deol from Gaddar when I saw the actual video of this incident 😂. The group of friends of his and the bride were completely occupied with their immature jokes and gossips about concerts. They were least bit attentive to the needs of the couple and the festivities. They were just buzzing like PAPS on specific moments to capture the moment and then back to discussing about captions, filters, etc to post on Instagram.
They left after the pheras and didn't even stay till the Bidai. I felt terrible. What's this???!!! Who does this? You don't expect this from your "" close friends"". I was then again occupied with other errands like getting older people and other guests to groom's home, station or hotels. Getting dining setup for the big family dinner, bringing in gifts, etc.
I stuck around, helped with packing, loading stuff back into the cars, surprisingly he noticed I wasn't there at the dining table, so he called me to join his family for dinner. I had a hilarious moment at the dining table. I was served a piece of sandwich and right then at that instant comes the cameraman putting his camera into my face and i started laughing 😂😂😂 I told, Bhai meme baneyga kya mera? Dost ki shadi me dost sandwich me concentrate kar raha hai😂😂😂. P.S. We didn't get to eat anything except a few starters from 8am till 7pm. 
Took the bride and the groom and his parents in my car to his place. Again took all the stuff from multiple cars up to his home, sorted them out again. Informed everything to his parents. Then there were some pooja to be done to welcome the bride to her newly wedded home. Sat finally, had small talks with his relatives. The best part of the day, was when his Grandparents thanked me and gave me their blessings for being there the whole day and helping them. His parents and relatives also acknowledged that and asked me about our friendship, like are you college friend or school friends, they were surprised that we are friends over 20 years. Then he called me to his room, to sit with him and the bride, we were just chilling and having fun, gossiping about some weird stuff at the wedding and they were teasing me ki Agla number tera hai, koi pasand aayi kya aaj, etc etc.
I told him, I will take your leave now... By then I was with him over 14 hours, that's when he hugged me and thanked me. I was happy for him. And I was happy that I did go and didn't miss out on his special day. His thanks was not what I was working for, but that was a moment, an indication of respect and value for this friendship. 
I loved doing every bit of things I did today in his wedding. I didn't do for his appreciation or respect. I had a duty ""Farz"" as a brother, I hope i did justice to it...
He is a married man now. I just hope to see him regularly and wish him a happy and healthy married life.",2739,514,1733337946,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1h6np2y/hurt_by_the_least_expected_person/

I paid ₹31,188 upfront and informed them on Day 1 that I have an allergy to cauliflower rice — something they had previously accommodated without issue.

This time, they flat-out refused to make substitutions and said they are “not considering allergy or dislike preferences anymore.”
Despite offering medically-backed meal plans, they didn’t care about an actual allergy.

When I requested cancellation:

They paused my subscription without asking
Promised a refund of ₹29,648 (after deducting one day’s meal)
It’s now been over a month
I’ve followed up multiple times and all I get are delays, excuses, and “we’re processing”
🔴 Summary:
Paid: ₹31,188
Promised Refund: ₹29,648
Time Since Cancellation: Over a month
Status: No refund, just automated replies
Location: Mumbai (but they deliver across cities including Bangalore & Delhi)
If anyone is considering Food Darzee or believes the marketing hype around “celebrity nutritionists,” please be cautious. The branding looks polished, but the customer service is appalling and unethical when it comes to real issues.

1lypr8l,mumbai,Verge of breaking up with my GF,"I’m 26 and have been in a relationship for 6 months with a girl I’ve known as a friend for over 3 years. Its a first relationship for both of us, Things were going well until yesterday when we met and started talking about our lives and family issues. She mentioned that her elder sister rejected a guy who was doing MBBS, and when I asked why, she said her standards aren’t that low to marry someone like that. I was genuinely confused. Then the conversation shifted towards us. I earn ₹50K a month as an ops manager with a BSc in Math i worked my ash of and learning new skill month by month trying to teach her about financial habits but ignores as if it's not important, and she earns ₹25K as a teacher with a B.Ed. We're from different castes — I’m OBC, and she’s from an upper caste. ( Yeah this is still a thing ) She then said if I want to marry her, I should be earning more than ₹2 lakh a month and have my own flat in Mumbai, separate from my family's she told that's not her demand that her family seeks in man whether he is worthy or not for her . I sarcastically commented on how shallow that mentality is, and she immediately got angry and said it’s over, claiming I don’t understand her.

I calmly told her that I too have preferences in marriage, but before I could even explain, she jumped in saying she can’t cook for me, only eat.(Despite knowing that I love her cooking even she is not good at it ,I also do thing she loves looking at her smile gives me immense pleasure ) but the things are right now making me angry and politely asked her if she had any idea what she was talking about. I pointed out that her whole family's combined income — including her dad, sister, brother, and herself — is around ₹1.4 lakh a month, yet she expects me alone to earn ₹2 lakh and buy a flat in South Bombay. (Tried to gave her reality check but it didn't work out )I asked if she thought she was in a love story or applying for a luxury merger. I reminded her that if it’s really about love, why does it all sound like a transaction. 

Am I wrong here? 
did i crossed the line ?
I am having second thought on this relationship and planning to end it.
Is that how most of the gf bf talk like that? Ex:- if you can't be this/that then you can't be with me .


Quick note to everyone I am about to buy a flat with my family's help with the capital salary and funds we have we are planning to close 40L loan in 3 years . She said if I ever bought this it should be in my name alone . I was about to share this happiness with her but she left me in a coffee shop and blocked me everywhere because she got hurt by what I told her about her family mentality.

I am not trying to make her seem bad or dumb what I  wrote is only what she told me yesterday.

EDIT:- Thank you for all the advice, I was convinced that I was wrong here because I cannot talk about this with my friend & family, I needed serious advice which I got thank you reddit community you guys are the best ",822,495,1752403239,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1lypr8l/verge_of_breaking_up_with_my_gf/

1mjwp9f,mumbai,He Told Me He Loved Me During a Video Call — and Got Engaged the Same Day,"
I (30F) just want to scream into the void, and maybe this post will help me let some of it out.

I was in an 8-year-long relationship. We’ve been through a lot — including living together for 4 years in Mumbai. He was my best friend, my person, my home. We had future plans, talked about marriage, supported each other’s careers. Everything seemed fine, even beautiful.

Just a few days ago, he came to visit me in Mumbai. We went on dates, laughed like always, and he even bought me a shirt and shoes to wish me luck for an important interview. I gave him his birthday gift. Everything felt normal, even loving.

On the day of my interview, we spoke on a video call before I left. He said “I love you” and wished me luck.

That same evening, he video-called again — but this time, something was different. I noticed a ring on his finger. When I asked about it, he lied, tried to brush it off, but I pressed. Eventually, it came out: he had gotten engaged. That very day. In a big ceremony.

I still can’t process how someone can say “I love you” and then put a ring on someone else’s finger in the same 24 hours. I didn’t even find out in some distant way — I had to witness it on his hand, through a call we were on. The betrayal wasn’t just physical or emotional — it was theatrical.

I want to take revenge. I want him to feel every ounce of humiliation and betrayal I’ve felt. But I also want peace. I’m torn between rage and numbness. Between wanting closure and wanting him to vanish from memory.

What stings even more is that I’m a Tier 1 graduate, financially independent, and doing really well for myself. He, on the other hand, got engaged to someone who earns barely a quarter of what I do. Not that money defines worth — but after everything I brought to the table, he still chose convenience and deception over commitment and respect.


I’ve been trying to keep it together, but the grief is real. It’s not just the end of a relationship — it’s the end of the version of my life that I thought was real.

I know I’ll move on. I know I’ll heal. But today, I’m broken. And I just needed to say it out loud.

1l5q95l,mumbai,Earning ₹2.5L/month in Mumbai but still can’t afford a proper home. How messed up is this?,"I earn ₹2.5 lakh per month, which most people would say is a really good salary in India. Still, living in Mumbai with my small family, I can’t even afford to buy a decent home.

And I’m not talking about some fancy luxury flat — just a proper, safe, spacious apartment in a good location with basic, real amenities. But even that costs ₹5 crore or more. Even if I try to settle for something around ₹3 crore, the EMI comes out to over ₹1.5 lakh per month. That’s basically most of my salary gone. No space to take risks, no backup, no freedom. Just keep working to pay the bank.

This is not just my story. This is happening to a lot of working professionals who are earning well but still stuck renting or forced to live far away from the city in average places after paying crores. What’s the point of earning so much if you still feel insecure about something as basic as a home?

It honestly feels like we’re trapped in a system where you’re expected to spend your whole life working just to afford a roof over your head. You take a loan, work non-stop to pay EMIs for 20–30 years, and by the time you’re done, you’ve spent your best years just “managing.” No freedom, no break, no second chances.

And the scary part is this is the reality for someone in the top 2% income group. So just imagine how bad things are for the rest of the working class. How are they even surviving? What kind of future are we building here?

I think people really need to talk more about this. It’s not just “oh Mumbai is expensive” it’s becoming unlivable for the very people who keep the city running. Maybe it’s time we stopped normalizing this lifestyle trap and started asking tougher questions about how broken this system really is.

1kq7ifm,mumbai,Advocate Sues Gucci For Selling 'Defective' Shoes; Demands ₹1 Crore Compensation For Mental Agony.,"A Mumbai-based advocate, has filed a case in the consumer court against international fashion house Gucci, alleging that a defective pair of shoes he purchased led to serious injury and ongoing trauma.

According to the complaint filed before the Suburban Mumbai District consumer dispute redressal commission, Advocate had purchased a pair of shoes along with a belt from a Gucci store.

However as per the complaint copy, shortly after wearing the shoes, he reportedly experienced a severe fall on two separate occasions due to defects in the footwear, including premature deterioration of the sole and an uneven elevation between the left and right shoes. The advocate claimed these defects caused him ongoing leg pain and significant emotional distress.

The problem was compounded by the lack of reaction from the brand. As the complainant visit to the store to complain, he was redirected to the Gucci store at Jio World Plaza in Bandra Kurla Complex, where he was greeted with ""dismissive and unhelpful"" attitudes by the brand representative.

While the complainant have also attached the letter as an official confirmation from Gucci dated March 7, 2024, indicating that a company engineer inspected the shoes and checked for a ""slight difference"" in height between the two shoes and complained about discomfort.

Even with this acknowledgment, the company did not provide a proper solution and compelled the advocate to go to the consumer court.

The advocate has sought a total compensation of ₹1 crore for the mental agony and trauma he has endured. In addition to this, he has also demanded a reimbursement of ₹9,500, the amount according to him, which he was compelled to spend on purchasing an alternative pair of shoes, and ₹50,000 for litigation expenses incurred in pursuing the case.

Still, I see people living and earning in Maharashtra disrespecting Marathi culture as if they’re ‘conquering’ the locals. As Indians, we keep migrating for jobs, money, dreams. Be it Mumbai or foreign countries. But here’s the truth: we often settle for less, work harder for less pay, and think that’s something to be proud of. It’s not. It’s desperation disguised as hustle. I’ve seen foreign companies hire Indians not because we’re the best but because we’re willing to work for the least. On the other hand, many Marathi people I know won’t accept that not out of ego, but out of self-respect.

1ikxjq0,mumbai,Is Zoomcar Running an Illegal Rental Operation? Our Shocking Experience in Mumbai,"Hello everyone,

I want to share a shocking experience my friends and I had with Zoomcar in Mumbai, hoping it serves as a warning and helps us explore potential legal action against Zoomcar.

**The Incident:**

We booked a self-drive car through Zoomcar for a day to explore Mumbai. Upon collecting the vehicle, we noticed it had a white number plate (private registration), which seemed unusual because self-drive rental cars must have black number plates with yellow lettering as per Indian transport laws. However, we overlooked this detail and went ahead with our plans.

Late at night, while returning, we were stopped at a police checkpoint. After routine checks, the officer asked whether the car was privately owned or rented. When we informed him it was a Zoomcar rental, he immediately pointed out that private registration vehicles cannot be used for self-drive rentals and mentioned imposing a fine of ₹20,000.

We were completely shocked and caught off guard. We tried reaching Zoomcar’s customer support, but found no direct helpline in the app. Desperate for help, we called the vehicle owner listed in the Zoomcar app, but his response was even more alarming—he simply told us to ""settle"" the matter with the police and offered no assistance whatsoever.

**Zoomcar’s ""Host"" Program—A Legal Loophole?**

Later when we went to return the car, we noticed that all the cars in the Zoomcar parking lot had white number plates! This means Zoomcar is actively renting out private vehicles through its “Host” program, potentially violating Indian transport laws that prohibit private vehicles from being used for commercial rental purposes.

**Key Concerns:**

**1. Is Zoomcar Operating Illegally?**

Self-drive rental cars must have black number plates with yellow letters. Private vehicles (white number plates) cannot be rented out for commercial purposes. If Zoomcar is allowing privately registered vehicles on its platform, is it violating Indian transport laws?

**2. Mental Harassment & Accountability:**

We paid a significant amount for the rental, expecting legal compliance and support. Instead, we were put in a stressful and legally risky situation late at night. Zoomcar was unreachable when we needed them most, and the car owner’s response was unacceptable. Zoomcar’s ""Host"" model appears to be a grey area, where customers bear all the risks.

**Seeking Advice:**

* Is Zoomcar’s use of private vehicles for rentals legal?
* Can we take legal action against Zoomcar for negligence and misrepresentation?
* Has anyone else faced a similar issue? If so, what steps did you take?

This experience was frustrating and distressing, and we don’t want others to go through the same ordeal. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Stay informed and stay safe!

**Legal References:**

* The Motor Vehicles Act states that only vehicles with commercial permits (black plates with yellow letters) can be used for rentals. Renting out privately registered vehicles is illegal.
* The Transport Department has warned against the use of private vehicles for rental purposes, stating that violators can face heavy penalties.
* Online discussions suggest that several users have unknowingly rented illegally operated Zoomcars, leading to legal troubles.

**Is Zoomcar taking advantage of customers by operating in a legal grey area?**",76,41,1739048457,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1ikxjq0/is_zoomcar_running_an_illegal_rental_operation/

Ali bhai, the tapri owner, calls me aside: “Sir, job ka kuch ho sakta hai kya? Mere ek dost ka haal kharab hai.”

I thought it was the usual, but then he drops a bomb this friend of his, a sales/telecalling guy was working in some telesales company in Malad, took a 2-year gamble to open a mobile shop, and now he’s 40 lakh down. Not a typo or exaggeration 40 lakh, all gone. I made Ali Bhai repeat it, thinking maybe I misheard. He calls his friend over, and the full story comes pouring out. Dude left his stable job (last drawn 26k + incentives), dreamt big, opened the shop in a high-profile locality. Hired a full team, spent bomb on fancy repairing gear, went all-in hoping things would take off.

Reality check: Shop bled money, business tanked, and after 2 years he’s left with a huge loss, staff gone, savings wiped out. I just sat there, stunned. Told him “Bhai, 5-6 lakh mein rok lete, at least recovery ka scope banta.” Now he’s honestly ready for any job said, “Agar 15-20 hazaar bhi mil jaaye toh theek hai.” Gave me his resume. I passed it to HR. Fingers crossed, but that damage is real.

Why Share This?

We see these hustle stories everywhere “Go big or go home,” “Follow your dreams” but rarely do we hear about the flipside, about betting the house and losing it. I’m not saying don’t dream, just dream with your eyes open. Take risks, sure, but also know your limits. Don’t throw in your lifelong savings in one shot. If things go wrong, trust me, there are very few people left to clean up the mess. Never ignore proper planning, cash flow, or worst-case scenarios. No shame in stability or slowing down a little especially if you’re the sole earning member.

After this story what I want to tell peeps here on this channel that if you’re trying to run a business and feeling stuck, especially with online marketing, SEO, getting traction, or even just basic brand management I’ll help. No charge, pay whatever you want, whenever you start earning, even if you don't pay I wont expect anything just don't go all in and make some random choices out of heat. Just DM me because I’ve seen how tough it is out there.

On a personal note:

Had to cut down from 23 cigarettes daily to just 2 now, and I’ve quit vaping for good. Tiny wins count too. If you’re still reading, maybe my little chai tapri story will stop someone from making the same mistake.

1n4qbfd,mumbai,Dunkin Doughnuts - The Rise of the Stretchy Vada in Mumbai,"You might be wondering why the hell I’m bringing up an American QSR brand in a Mumbai street food post. But hear me out. Separated by thousands of miles and oceans, the similarities are fucking uncanny. I’m talking about the medu vadas sold by pom pom vendors in the early morning hours. I call them ***the stretchy vadas.***

These aren’t your regular medu vadas from Udupi restaurants. Hell, they’re not even close to the overfried, crispy ones most street vendors make fresh. This post is about the mass-produced, maida and rice flour-filled vadas that are spongy, stretchy, and the perfect vehicle for chutney. They’re one-of-a-kind vadas you won’t find anywhere outside Mumbai.

Are they authentic? Not even fucking close. If a Kannadiga ate this, the language wars would be overshadowed by the vada wars. Belgaum what?

***What Makes These Vadas Different***

These vadas are more bread than legume. Unlike a proper medu vada that you’d get in a Bangalore darshini - crispy outside, fluffy inside, eaten with a spoon. These stretchy bastards are designed to be held. You grab them with your fingers and dunk them into that white liquidy chutney, or the thick white solid stuff, red tomato-garlic, or the watery tangy-sweet sambar. I’m team thick white chutney and red chutney.

What makes these vadas genius is how they soak up every drop of that chutney, elevating the entire experience. But here’s the catch, *if the chutney is shit, the fall is as dramatic as the high.* These vadas are naked without good chutney.

And they’re never piping hot. They’re always stacked like a leaning tower, wrapped in that iconic blue polythene bag. It reminds me of those doughy snacks I had in Singapore with pork broth, or in Vietnam with pork knuckle porridge. Instead of broth, the chutney does all the heavy lifting. If you dipped this vada in sugar-coated syrup, I wouldn’t be surprised if it tasted exactly like a doughnut.

These vadas are made in massive batches in Dharavi and sold to vendors who buy them in bulk. If you’re ever at Sion station at 4 AM, you’ll see lines of vendors walking on the tracks, waiting to board the first train with their day’s stock. That’s why once they’re sold out, there’s no fresh batch waiting.

Here’s what most people don’t notice - there are actually two different operations running simultaneously in this city. The cycle walas position themselves strategically outside railway stations, schools, colleges, and office clusters. Then you have the head-balancing champions - the pom pom walas as I like to call them, who roam residential areas with vessels on their heads, sounding that iconic horn.

Back in the 90s, annas used to come to our chawl shouting “Idli! Vada! Dosa!” Over the years, they’ve evolved. Instead of shouting, they use that famous BEST bus horn - the pom pom sound that gives them their name.

They’ve transitioned from walking to cycles, and the original Tamil annas have mostly been replaced by migrants from the north. The business model remains the same, but the faces have changed.

When I’m working on projects and offered a full English breakfast or an avocado sandwich, I always ask the same question: “Is there a pom pom wala nearby?” Sometimes you want that perfectly imperfect stretchy vada that reminds you why Mumbai’s food scene is built on adaptation, not preservation.

My Favorite Pom Pom Spots:

    •Juhu near SNDT College
    
    •Outside Churchgate railway station: Wee hours of the morning
    
    •Outside Bhavans College, Andheri:Two annas compete against each other.",1298,113,1756632308,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4qbfd

The Shocking Truth About BMC Corporators — And How You Can Make a Difference!,"Guys, just yesterday I was trying to find out who the corporator (aka nagarsevak) of my ward is—and guess what? I struggled because the BMC website is *not* optimized for this information. So, I turned to Perplexity, which works like a supercharged Google search, and found out something shocking: **there are no current corporators for any ward under BMC**! It’s been *3 years* without elections, and now the whole city is under the Commissioner’s control.

This got me thinking—if we don’t have elected representatives, what are *we* doing to improve our own neighborhoods? Have you reported issues, posted on Twitter, or come up with some clever, indirect way to make things better in your locality? I’m fed up with the poor condition of my area, and when I visit places like Matunga, everything looks so clean, hawker-free, and well-maintained.

So, I want to hear from you! What steps have you taken to keep your area clean or improve public services in the absence of corporators? Share your ideas or stories—who knows, it might inspire others to take charge and create real change.

1lsg8vn,mumbai,What do you say about this unexplainable and silent hatred towards Marathis ?,"Rather than giving statements on what is happening why don't you ask yourself WHY this is happening ?
  
Until last year, I was against people beating migrants mainly poor people who do labour work leaving their families behind to earn a living, or bank employees who study for 3–4 years to get a government job and get posted literally 1000s of km away from their home, and then assaulted by political parties pushing their agendas for votes 
 
But then came a series of viral incidents that made me rethink literally all my assumptions and how wrong I had been.
 
 
1) A Gujarati flat owner in Ghatkopar  refused to rent his flat to a Marathi woman in her own state capital mumbai, openly saying, “Marathi people are dirty, they eat meat and fish.” 
 
 
2)A leaked call recording in which a company(based in Mumbai) manager from Maharashtra clearly says multiple times: “ye mera wusool hai ki mai musalmano ko aur marathiyo ko kaam pe rakhta hi nahi.”
 
 
3) A Marathi family was beaten by a Gujarati family in Mumbai simply for keeping a dog in their own flat.
 
 
4) A Zoom meeting screen recording went viral in which a instagram jyotishi woman mocked a girl for getting engaged to a Marathi man, she literally said 'koi punjabi,  chandigarh ka, delhi ka ladka dhund leti... Ye kya hai marathi ? Innki toh koi standing* hi nahi hai koi aukaat* hi nahi hai, ab baithna aunty logo me wo nauvari* pehan ke.


5) 2024 mumbai girgao incident where in an advertisement they explicitly stated 'marathi people need not to apply'. 


6) Gujaratis not renting a flat to Marathis in areas like ghatkopar (2025 incident), mulund 2023 incident, so many examples in ghatkopar, mira road, malad, matunga, parel kandivali, borivali
 

 
And these are just a few examples there are many many more like them.
 
 What explains this growing and often unspoken hatred toward Marathi people in their own state?
 
As someone who has always supported the BJP, I find myself seriously supporting the Thackeray brothers this time. If the government continues to push the idea of Hindi imposition across India, especially in states with strong regional identities, there are only two outcomes:
 
 
1. The political parties from both sides will get their vote banks and most importantly:-
 
2. It will create deep, irreversible hatred between communities, ethnicities which will not be undone. fellow citizens will despise each other and make our country hollow within.

Im posting this after reading comments on reddit, twitter, instagram. You people made us look like we are anti nationals, hate mongers, radicles **for mere revolt against another regional language that holds no connection to us**


**I don't want to spread hatred or negativity but  put yourself in our shoes once and see your moral preaching of comment section dissolving**
   
It's so easy to preach unity, tolerance, gyaan until is happens to yourself. Until you get disrespected sidelined, stereotyped on your own land.
 

 
Just look at how South Indian states have responded to similar attempts in the past.

They literally hate north Indians for imposing hindi on them do you want similar thing to happen in Maharashtra. Marathis have been most warm, welcoming and tolerant people in this matter



Question:-
1.How about adding a agriculture or IT or basic economics subjects rather than a language which student may never use ?
Adding agriculture would (i) give employment to agri graduates, (ii) they will do extension work and help farmers exploring scientific approach in their day to day practices?!
 Literally 700+ farmers killed themselves in Maharashtra within 3 months . And here government adding a language in curriculum 
 
2. How about keeping English as a link language along with native language of respective region ?

1ky2cn6,mumbai,"Snacks, Rejections & Shaadi Proposals: Life in a 10x10 Chawl","So, I grew up in a 10x10 feet chawl room in Mumbai—no bathroom, no privacy, and definitely no room for secrets. It was me, my parents, and my elder sister all packed like vada pavs in a dabba. But you know what? It never felt small. That tiny space was bursting with laughter, late-night Maggi, and enough love to make Shah Rukh Khan’s movies feel underwhelming.

We never really felt poor, until the great Indian ritual began—groom hunting for my sister.

Now, let me tell you—my sister is the full package. Highly educated, smart, good-looking. Basically, if arranged marriages were Shark Tank, she'd have gotten “All 5 sharks on board.”

So we thought—how much can one tiny room matter? Turns out, A LOT.

Every weekend, new prospects would march in. Some ultra-rich, some semi-rich, some just there for the snacks (I see you, Rohit from Dombivli). But they all had the same reaction—the moment they entered our chawl, their facial expressions changed like they'd just walked into a horror film set.

It was like, “Oh wow, your daughter is so impressive!”

Five seconds later after seeing the room: “Oh...this is...cozy.”

One guy even whispered to his mom, “Where’s the bathroom?” and when she whispered back “There isn’t one,” he looked at me like I was trying to sell him a house on the moon.

The worst were the “gyaan gurus.”

They would look around and say things like:

“Your father has been in Mumbai for 50 years, and couldn’t even buy a 1BHK?”

I wanted to reply, “Uncle, he bought us dignity, and you left yours in the car.”

We did this every weekend for FOUR YEARS. I swear, our weekends weren’t Saturday-Sunday anymore—they were “Shaadi Episode 231” and “Rejection Episode 232.”

And don’t even get me started on the snacks. We served chakli, samosa, jalebi, farsan, chai like we were running a full-fledged catering business. I once told my mom,

“If we had invested all this money in the stock market instead of kachoris, we’d be crorepatis by now.”

She didn’t laugh. She just handed me another tray of sev puri and said, “Go, the groom’s family is here.”

Eventually, my sister did marry a truly wonderful man. Simple, kind, and didn’t ask “Where is the bathroom?” on his first visit. They have two adorable kids now, and they still visit our old chawl from time to time.

But you know what? That whole experience left a deep impression on me. It taught me that people often carry measuring tapes in their minds—measuring success in square feet, not human values. And for those people, no house will ever be big enough to contain their small-mindedness.

But us?

We had a small room.

And a big heart.

And now, we also have a great story.",876,191,1748494634,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1ky2cn6/snacks_rejections_shaadi_proposals_life_in_a/

People were stuck in their vehicles for hours, and every station I passed through was packed like crazy busy by the protesters. Luckily, I didn’t have work today but I can only imagine how badly the working crowd must have suffered.

1m7z602,mumbai,Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab demands minister Yogesh Kadam’s resignation over ‘Kandivali dance bar run with mother’s license’,"Shiv Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab on Tuesday demanded the resignation of Maharashtra Minister of State for Home Yogesh Kadam, alleging that a dance bar in Kandivali was being operated under a licence held by his mother and that firms linked to the minister’s family were mining sand illegally in Ratnagiri.

Parab said he would submit documents, pen drives, and evidence to Chief Minister [Devendra Fadnavis](https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis/) on Wednesday and warned he would approach the Bombay High Court if Kadam was not removed from his post. Kadam belongs to the Shinde-led [Shiv Sena](https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/).

Parab’s allegations stem from a May 30 raid at Savali Bar and Restaurant in Kandivali (West), following which the [Mumbai](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/) police booked 22 bar dancers, 22 customers, and four staff members for violations under bar regulations. Citing documents received under the Right to Information Act, Parab said the bar’s license was in the name of Jyoti Kadam, the minister’s mother.

“If obscene activities take place in a bar licensed to the minister’s family, responsibility lies with the license holder. Saying it is run by someone else is no defense under the law,” the MLC said at a press conference.

Parab alleged that bar rules were violated, with reports of obscene dance and money being thrown—all of which he claimed was documented in an FIR. Former minister Ramdas Kadam, father of Yogesh Kadam, admitted that the license is in his wife’s name but said the bar has been run by a man named Shetty for 30 years.

Parab also accused Kadam of diverting silt from the Jagbudi river in Ratnagiri, stating that sand meant for farmers was instead sent to a private dental college allegedly linked to Kadam’s sister. He named Akil Mukadam, who he claimed works at Kadam’s residence, as the one overseeing the illegal sand removal.

Kadam, in response, denied all charges, saying he had no involvement in the operation of the bar or in sand removal, and that the allegations were “baseless and defamatory”. He said the silt removed was not of construction quality. “There is an orchestra license and waitress license. Nothing illegal is happening,” he said, dismissing Parab’s claims as politically motivated.

1jzxl2w,mumbai,"Rising ""Dadagiri Group"" Harrasment in Virar Local Train","
Above video is from Virar-Andheri slow local leaving at 8:15 from Virar.

This was a result of an outburst by the general public against these Group Dada's who are harrassing the general public everyday.

This has been a Running for a Long time now and I'm fed up of this sh*t.

These MFers are gettirg away with it thinking inke Baap ki Local hai since they Travel everyday.

Here are the things that they'll do

1. Run a informal seat booking system for other ""Members"". 
Dude will grab a seat which he has no intention of giving away. 
Why?

When you ask him ""Kaha utarne wale ho bhaiyya?"" 
He'll say ""Seat to gayi teri beta.. Bhul jaa Ab... Tereko Chadne diya wahi Meherbaani samaj.""

Turns out the next heir to this seat has not even boarded this train yet. 
He'll board the train at some odd station later and claim his rightful right as a Bastard to his Throne.

(Mind you these MFers will start grabbing seats for Churchgate/Andheri bound locals right from the Trains return journey itself. 
And this type of Group mobbing is also Happening in the LADIES COMPARTMENT)

Quick personal story: 
One time I grabbed a Seat from one of these assholes fair and square. 
For a few stations he remained quite aur chup chaap khada raha. His other ""Members"" meanwhile had grabbed the seats beside me. 
Baadme when his other Group members arrived, they collectively started saying ""Bohot hogya baithke ab dusro ko bhi baithne de. Puuri Journey baithke jaaega kya?"" 
When I refused to give up the seat they became really agro and started Gaali-Galoch with me. 
I eventually gave up that seat so as to not let that escalate further but I was furious. 
I stopped boarding that train in the morning altogether and started using the company bus for commute (I had the privilege of having that option, unfortunately millions don't).

Fortunately found a remote gig soon after that and stopped going via Local all-together. 
I can only imagine the trauma for someone who has to bear this harrassment everyday. 

2. Control who gets to get In or Out at the Gate. 
I swear to God, this one infuriates me so much. 
Most of the Compartments are packed during peak hours. 
But inn haramiyo ko apne dabbe me extra jaga chaiye. 
Ye Darwaje pe aise khade rahenge jaise inke Baap ki Train hai and they get to decide who gets In or Out, even when there is plenty of space inside to stand.

I've watched so many altercations becoz of reason no.2 that I've lost count.
I think there was a incident on Harbour line last year too, where the public dragged these gate keepers out and beat them Black-n-Blue before handing them to the RPF.

Inn MChdo ko bhi abhi yahi karna padega.
Uske bagair sudhrenge nahi ye. 

I'm writing this post as an effort to unite against these assholes and name and shame them.

Ye Fattu log sirf Group me hi 🦁 bante firte hai. Once you are show them that you won't tolerate this Bullshit and have numbers behind you too, ye sidha 😺 
ban jaate hai.

If you're one of the daily victims of this, comment below your boarding train timing, station and platform no. to connect with others who are facing the same problem.
Photograph them and report them to the RPF as a group.

Then let's see inme kitna dum hai.

1m5nfew,mumbai,Need Advice: Fun 5K Run with Friends + Weekend Plans Around Mumbai (Help Needed!),"Hey people!

A group of 5–6 of us (mix of both genders) is planning to participate in the upcoming Half Marathon event. Most of my friends (everyone except me, really) don’t or can’t run much, so we’re thinking of signing up for the 5K Tribute Fun Run instead. I had a few questions and would really appreciate your input:

1. Has anyone participated in this event in the past?
How was your experience? Do you think it’s a good idea to (gently) push/motivate my friends to join? I’m trying to make it fun and memorable for them, even if they’re not runners.

2. Logistical questions — especially about Sunday:

All my friends will be arriving from outside Mumbai on Friday and heading back Sunday evening/night. The tentative plan is to spend Friday and Saturday somewhere outside Mumbai, then return Sunday morning for the event.

What time should we ideally reach the venue and how much time does the 5K event usually take?

Are there any fun things to do nearby post-run?,,

Can we store luggage somewhere at the event or nearby (since we might head straight to the airport)?....

Also, any suggestions on how to manage accommodation/logistics for Sunday?

3. Quick getaway suggestion,,,,, Karjat or Matheran?
We’re torn between Karjat and Matheran for the Friday–Saturday outing. Which one would you recommend and what can we do there in a short trip?
PS: I'm new to this state, so don't know much. 

Thanks in advance! Really looking forward to making this a great weekend with the gang,,,,,,,your tips will help a ton",0,1,1753115000,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1m5nfew/need_advice_fun_5k_run_with_friends_weekend_plans/

1lj9wh9,mumbai,Horrible experience today as woman first time in Mumbai.,"I have always heard that Mumbai is safe. And as a 20 year old woman from Delhi I was super excited to move to Mumbai for 2 months for my internship. As a person who grew up in Delhi I was easily impressed by Mumbai initially, which is rare as other cities don't usually please me. 

But today was different, I was overly confident on the ""safety"" aspect of Mumbai. I grew up learning that Delhi is unsafe for girls (it surely is, I get stares and catcalls on daily basis). But the experience I had today was not even at par with what I faced in Delhi. Usually, if I don't get an auto, I start walking towards my home as it is only 2km away from my house, if I get an auto on my way I sit in that. Today was same, I started walking, I got an auto, and I sat in that auto. Only a few meters away someone entered the auto, sitting with me, might be autowala's friend. I got scared but I couldn't react more than ""arey!"" Then he started asking me questions.

-""Naam kya hai aapka?""
-""Anshika"" I lied
-""XYZ company me kaam krti ho?""
-""haan"" couldn't lie
-""kya krti ho?""
-""internship""

Then he started poking me on my waist.

Gesturing to give him my contact number.

He did it twice or thrice and I snapped towards the end.

I got visibly uncomfortable and clutched my phone and dialled my mom (didn't ring)

The I noticed the meter, something was off, it wasn't reset and I pointed it out hastily.

He reset that saying ""arey sab theek hai""

I was scared shitless and there was a monorail station nearby.

It was obvious to him that I won't give him my number because I almost yelled ""nhi dena hai number"".

So he said ""aap dar kyu rahe ho aapko yahi utaar de aapse paise nhi lenge aap jao""

I said ""haan please""

Then his friend stopped the auto, he actually stopped the auto near an interior road turn so I was extremely scared that he might not stop and take me somewhere shady, as I was on the inside I couldn't just jump out of the auto.

""Daro mat bas side me rok rhe hai""

I got off, after this ordeal, I called my mom immediately. My legs were shaking and I couldn't walk out of fear.

I told her that I was walking to home. She said okay come.

Then I shared this with my best friend in voice notes and she pointed out ""bhai baal baal Bach gyi otherwise kuch bhi kr skte the 2 log atleast chain snatching wagera""

And I actually did wear diamond pendant and ring.

I have never faced this kind of thing in Delhi, and I've been in Mumbai only for 3 weeks now.

To this I would like to add one more incident, which happened in mumbai local. I was riding for the first time as ""a very enthusiastic tourist"" for ""authentic mumbai experience"" and got groped by a man, tbh I didn't even notice it, I was with my mom and he groped both of us. But my mom is a very fierce lady and she hit him HARD. Nobody said a word because he knew that he was guilty. At that time it wasn't even a week in Mumbai.

Craziest thing is all of this never happened in Delhi!! 

Now I am not saying Delhi is better than Mumbai but I think generalizing any city or name-calling is bad. Every place is horrible for women.

PS: I have heard Maharashtrians and south Indians say north Indian women dress ""indecently"" and ruin the atmosphere here. I was wearing full sleeves shirt, even my wrists were hidden and jeans along with safety shoes (I work in core engineering) and only skin visible was my face and neck. And when the train incident happened I wore high neck tshirt, half sleeves till my elbow and jeans.",503,219,1750768405,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1lj9wh9/horrible_experience_today_as_woman_first_time_in/

1lppm0z,mumbai,They Came. They Saw. They Fled. Welcome to Ola/Uber at 4AM,"So this happened recently, and I’m still pissed off.

I had a train to catch from Dadar Terminus at 5:25 AM to my native place. Since I was traveling with my parents and we had a lot of luggage, I didn’t want to take the train to Dadar like I usually do. Instead, I thought I’d make things easier and book an Ola.

Big mistake.

At around 4:00 AM, I booked an Ola. Driver accepts, ETA 5 mins. We get ready, go downstairs with all the bags… and guess what? The guy literally pulls up near our place, sees us, and drives off. No call, no cancel, just vanishes.

I figured maybe it was a one off, so I booked another one. Same thing. Driver shows up, sees us from a distance, dips.

Tried a third Ola I was still hopeful. But again, same exact thing. At this point I’m genuinely wondering if we’re invisible or something.

It’s around 4:35 AM now, and I’m panicking because we’re running out of time. I switch to Uber thinking, okay maybe their drivers are more reliable.

Nope. Uber driver also shows up, sees us, and just takes off. 😑

Like seriously, if you don’t want to take a trip to Dadar early morning, or if you’re not happy with the luggage or fare why even accept the booking??

Luckily, a kaali-peeli cab passed by. I waved like a madman and convinced the guy to take us. Had to pay ₹100 extra but honestly, at that point I didn’t care. We made it just in time.

But man 4 drivers in a row doing this?? This is beyond frustrating. Ola/Uber support is just a joke with their copy paste replies. It’s scary how unreliable app based cabs have become, especially when you’re with family or have a time sensitive plan.

Anyone else faced something like this recently? Is this common during early morning hours?

- Only once did it arrive with a delay of 15 to 60 minutes.  
- The remaining 34 times, it was late by over an hour!

1i8rh2x,mumbai,I was called homophobic for rejecting a gay person’s advances,"I'm part of a friend circle where friends of friends often join our hangouts, so I meet a lot of new people. 

Last week, while we were at a pub, a guy who was a friend of a friend got a little too close while dancing and started trying to touch me. At first, I thought it was just playful fun, but then it got uncomfortable. I was pretty buzzed at that point, so I told him to back off, maybe a bit more harshly than I intended. After that, he just sat at the table for the rest of the night and didn’t participate in anything. 

A couple of days later, I ran into the girl who was friends with that guy, and she said I was really rude for how I handled it. I explained what happened, but she dismissed my feelings and accused me of being homophobic for pushing him away just because he was gay. I was taken aback and said,""What the heck? I’m straight! He can be gay all he wants, but I’m not comfortable with that!"" My friend kept trying to guilt-trip me over it.

I don’t get it! Was I wrong here? 



Edit: Thank you all for your support and reassurance. I spoke with my friend again, and she said she understands how I feel but thinks I could have handled the situation better and not hurt his feelings by being harsh. I'm still not sure what she meant by that! Anyway, that guy messaged me later (I’m sure how he got my number) and apologized, saying his behavior was due to being drunk.

I handed him his pav. He said thanks.

1l2yjqt,mumbai,"Need Advice – The same TC keeps stopping me daily, despite having a valid pass.","Hi everyone,

I take local train for my everyday commute to work, and i get down at XYZ station daily, and there’s a female TC late 20s, usually stationed near the first class compartment.

Last month, she stopped me every single day for 5 days to check my pass. Since it was the end of the month and my pass was about to expire, I assumed she was being cautious and I didn’t mind.

After that, I took the weekend off and renewed my pass from the 2nd of this month. But even on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, she continued to stop me to check, even though my new pass was clearly valid.

This has happened at least almost 8 times in the last 15 days. And it’s not like it’s random or crowd-based. Every time she’s there, she specifically stops me, even if it’s packed.

If there’s a crowd, she still stops me. If there’s no crowd and she stops me, only then she checks others too. But one way or another, she always ensures that I don’t walk past, like I’m trying to run away or dodge her. But why would I run? I have a valid pass!

And even if I wanted to say something, I don’t know what to say or how to bring it up. I honestly don’t mind showing my pass, even if 10 different TCs stop me. But when it’s just her stopping me daily, it starts getting on my nerves.

How do I politely let her know that this is getting irritating? Any advice on how to handle this maturely without causing unnecessary conflict?",359,272,1749018546,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1l2yjqt/need_advice_the_same_tc_keeps_stopping_me_daily/

1jn99aj,mumbai,Did kalsubai night Trek under 700rs,"As a beginner I did my first ever hike at kalsubai peak in December 24. I didn't find much info anywhere myself while planning. So I'll lay out some helpful tips on how you can plan it cheap yet worth the experience without tour package. 

Mumbai to kasara: Local train to Kasara (₹30), then bus to bari-Base Village(₹100). I'll recommend bus to keep it cheaper

Trek Difficulty: Moderate, takes ~3-4 hrs one way. Start at midnight for a stunning sunrise. Even as a beginner it's easy to navigate. Start slow and don't rush.

What to Pack: Good shoes, torch(night treks), warm clothes (for winters), and carry your own water (2L) ,light snacks, ORS , powerbank, light first-aid and knife. 
Tip- invest more on water and food. You will find stalls going uphill but it's costly

Cost Breakdown: I did the whole trek for under ₹700, while tours charge expensive rate with additional personal cost. 

Honestly plan it yourself with your friends to keep it fun and flexible. If you want I’ve put together a full step-by-step guide, budget breakdown, and tips based on my experience. 

Ask me if you have any other questions or DM to know more.

1k85vgi,mumbai,This city now hates you.,"I've been living in Bombay for the last 28 years. I've seen every phase of this city and the roads and traffic have been a perennial issue. It literally got added to a ""one-liner"" description of the city. But Bombay had its saving grace, the people. Everyone was incredibly warm and helpful. Heck people used to happily slowdown when you wanted to cross the road.

Now it's all gone to shit. Why? I have a theory: BMC.

Think about it. You now spend 40 minutes to cover a 3km distance, your car's average is 1/3rd of what it could be, you're surrounded by dust and have to deal with the ever-increasing but never-ending construction. Suddenly the traffic isn't ""part of the charm"" anymore, the waterlogged roads aren't ""romantic"", the overcrowded trains aren't ""part of the hustle"" and you're broken. You run out of justifications for poor management.

All of this, on top of already hectic work. So what happens? You're frustrated. Where does it come out? On the road. You honk, cut lanes, park wherever and definitely don't stop for pedestrians. Or if you're slightly calm, you shitpost on reddit.

On top of that He even called us ""gareeb"" as a punchline to one of the audience members interruptions! Never going to his gigs anymore for sure.

After leaving the venue it was complete pandemonium. No cab was available on uber, ola, rapido, even local kaali peeli were not ready to give us a ride unless we pay extra 200 bucks because EVERYWHERE WAS TRAFFUCKED!

Venue didn't have parking so couldn't bring our own vehicle & it took us an hour to get a cab by which time we were exhausted not to mention nearly run over by a couple cars and almost got into a fight with a rowdy driver. He had braked so we attempted to cross the road & suddenly accelerated nearly running me over, only to get stuck 10 seconds later in heavy traffic.

Took us another hour to travel 4.5 kms away in Khar for our dinner venue 🤣

I didn't mention it being jampacked by people literally everywhere we went because it's Mumbai after all, goes without saying. Also the 150+ AQI made everything even more terrible.

1ivi83d,mumbai,Visited Haji Ali Dargah today after years and here’s what I observed,"1. The Dargah is being run very poorly by the trust. No proper infrastructure and no around to assist or provide any sort of control/support.
2. The route towards the Dargah has improved massively, the tunnel like structure built in the route helps in the scorching heat. Very well appreciated.
3. The no of beggars has reduced a lot. Years ago, the place was filled with beggars of all sorts, the numbers have gone down significantly. 
4. No of shops have reduced as well. Not sure about the reason but the no of shops in the route have reduced a lot, including shops that used to sell religious books.
5. Less police officials around the area, again, not sure the reason but hardly found any police official there.
6. The Dargah appears to be less money hungry compared to other Dargah’s. 
7. People are dirty who don’t care about the cleanliness about the very holy place they pray at ",658,149,1740229284,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivi83d

1hd96pc,mumbai,Need your opinion ,"I am from Delhi and in a relationship with a Mumbai man. We often fight over the language/slang he uses for me and my family. According to him, using foul language is OK in Mumbai culture. However, I don't accept the way he uses foul language to me.  

I have tried many times explaining to him that it is not OK to use foul language for your girlfriend and her family. However, he denies it and says it is part of Mumbai culture. It is not Gaali but the way Mumbai people talk in general. But he never understands my point and concerns about this abusive language.

Therefore, I am writing this post to check with all Mumbai people (Men and women) if I am wrong about my Boyfriend's use of foul language towards me and my family.

**A recent example:** A few days ago, we were planning for the holiday together. I was concerned about what I would tell my family whom I was going on holiday with. Also, my elder brother might ask my friend's name if I tell him that I am going with some XY friend. I was discussing this with my Boyfriend that I am concerned about what I will tell my brother if he asks which hotel I am going to stay in or whom I am going to go on holiday with. While discussing my concerns with my Boyfriend, he said- Kya yaar tera bhai aisa kyun hai - **""Tere Bhai ki GAND MAIN ITNEY KEEDEY KYUN HAI.""**  I told him that you can't use this language for my brother. How can you say this to my brother? He argue that it is OK to say this as per Mumbai culture. I said, you might use this language among your friends but not for your girlfriend's brother. He got angry and kept saying the same thing at least 10 times when I raised my concerns that it was not OK to say this about my brother that **Tere bhai ki gand main keedy hain.**

There was a big fight on this. My Boyfriend later used foul language, He even called me **""Chutmarni ki""** and also abused my mother, said, **""Teri Maa ka Bhosda "".**

He is still saying that it is Mumbai slang and not gaali. I argued with him that if it is Mumbai slang and OK to use, can you use the same sentences for your parents and siblings? He said not at all. Suppose he can't say the same sentences (foul language) to his family; how can he use the same foul language for my family and me?

Please share your thoughts so I can tell him that using foul language toward his girlfriend and her family is not OK. Maybe your comments will help him understand that he can't use foul language toward his girlfriend and her family.",235,479,1734084756,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1hd96pc/need_your_opinion/
1kvpsyw,mumbai,My girl of 3 months wants to get married to me. I'm not ready. What do I do?,"So I (24M) met her (25F) through bumble 3 months ago.

We've been going strong, having fun, going through rough emotional phases together and helping each other grow to be better.

But her family is mostly conservative, which leads her to lie about her plans with me, whenever we go out, do stuff at my place, etc.

She works at a restaurant so she as it is doesn't have a lot of time to give to others but we make it work. So it grinds my gears when she only gets a second to herself and cannot/orwill not be honest with her folks about exploring life, relationships, and womanhood, with her parents.

Instead she thinks these issues will get solved if we just get married asap.

I've talked about this with her. I've also stated how I'm not ready yet, and would appreciate no ""jokes"" about this topic which make things awkward asap.

I come from a progressive family, so I've been encouraged to be honest with my folks about things. I think if she just has these difficult conversations about drawing boundaries with parents, etc; that would help solve the issue. Instead of marrying someone she's only known for 3 months.

She also has dreams of opening her own cafe in the future and might also think marrying me will finally give her the shortcut to getting funds for her business. (Not calling her a golddigger but she does seem to want to jump the gun and how marriage will solve this problem too)

Please help me out and talk to me about this. I don't wanna hurt her feelings.",279,186,1748250122,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1kvpsyw/my_girl_of_3_months_wants_to_get_married_to_me_im/

1i769p2,chennai,i got almost beaten to death yesterday outside kasi talkies,"Me and my friend went to eat yesterday night at the iraichi fried chicken shop right outside kasi talkies.

It was 730 and very crowded. There was no place to park my bike so i parked it in front of the next shop IMart which was empty and had lot of space.

we got our food and were eating on our bike. The shop owner came outside and started shouting and things got heated verbally. I told him i will move the bike just give me a min to throw the waste in a dustbin. He started shouting come here at once and loudly, i shouted back "" youw adhan yedukaren nu solten la adhukulla yenna kathhara"".

Two guys standing nearby (apparently DMK Gundas) friends of the owner started beating me saying that how dare to talk to him like that and stuff.

The beat me mercilessly for 10 - 15 mins on road.  They pushed me across the street, threw me on bikes , punched slapped kicked me in my head repeatedly and finally they took my helmet and banged it on my head 10 times.

Few people in the crowd and my friend tried to stop them, but they were 6ft+ 120kgs they could do nothing but watch. In he end the crowd managed to make some time for us to run away.

I went to R10 police station in MGR nagar and gave a written complaint. They sent one constable with me to the place, He went and talked to someone in IMart. They said they dont know the people who bet me. I Told him they are lying, he got extremely mad and started shouting ""yenna unaku yellame theriyuma neye enquiry panniko, yenna kudichirukiya thiripi thiripi pesara?'.

He then told me to come back tomorrow morning at 10 to the station and the people involved will be there,

After an hour or so he called back and said that he checked the cctv footage and saw what happened. He told me to come to\`\`\` the station in the evening.

What more am i supposed to do?

\*edit : grammar

  
Update 1: Went and waited in the station with all the documents, they didnt show up.   the poilice sent a constable to check the cctv again, and he recognized them he said. He went it their houses and had no luck it seems.  

They told me they will catch them and call me to station tomorrow.

I am happy the police are putting in effort.  

Apparently the MLC certificate will be given to only poilce it seems but i went and registered an AR(accident report)

I have a criminal lawyer friend who is advising me on what to do.

Will keep updating here . 

Thanks for all the support.

 maybe chennai is not hopeless Afterall.






Update 2:
Went to the station today and met the people.
Worst type of human beings.
The only person who talked sense was the inspector.
He was supporting me and scolded the imart employee
So the guy who was in Imart was not the owner just the manager

The people who assaulted me were party members.
But they were not DMK, they were ADMK.
I thought they were DMK because the bystanders told us.
Today they came with jayalalitha photo in their pockets.

They tried all text book variety of things to threaten me
1. Poi case poduvom
2. FIR pota unnala vela theda mudiyadhu, visa kadaikadhu
3. The owner of the store threatened me saying that if press charges he will counter sue by saying that i blocked traffic and income to his shop for 1hr 
4. Ne case pota kooda yenaku max 2k fine and 1day jail. Ne dhan court, station nu alayanum

They told me this is an everyday thing for them., going to station for cases and that there is no problem for them even if i put case also.

They changed the case by saying that I tried to hit them first and that i swore bad words at the shop manager.

Fortunately one of my friends know a DMK guy.
He called and talked to these people.

These people got scared after the call and agreed to reimburse my medical expenses and damage. 

The guy who bet me came and asked sorry multiple times profusely ( after talking to the inspector) 

He told me the reason he bet me was because i kept my grease hand on his shirt and caused a stain. 
He said, "" aana ne gethu da, yevlo adivangiyum thiripi yelundhu adkiva vandha pathiya adhu dhan dillu.
Na unna yelundhirika vidama kooda adicha kaarannam, ne chinna payyan, yenaku area la peru iruku reputation iruku, na unaa 10 adi adichalum ne yenna oru adi adicha adha dhan pesipanga. "" 

He had to maintain his reputation it seems. 

He asked my background family details and all. I told him i had no father and was the only earning member in my family. 

He said that he is not a violent person and has helped a lot of poor people and students. 
He gave me his number and details and told me to call him anytime in case i need any help 

In the end the gave me money and i had to write a letter and give to police that they investigated the matter and the parties have agreed to settle and that we have come to a compromise. 

The gave me cash for all the medical bills and left. 



Now, 
I want to leave this post here in the subreddit so that it stays as a record of the utterly disgusting state of chennai. 

Im not adding names of people because i dont want to blow this up further. Im tired. 

If you dont have any ounce of influence you have no hope getting any justice even if you are completely in the right. 

Fear and ignorance of law are the weapons of police and the thugs. 

I don't believe for a second that the guy who bet me is not violent, he was proudly saying that if this was 10yrs ago he would have threatened me to leave the station after giving the complaint  and that afterwards he would use all his influence to make my life hell. He said "" ne na adichen nu case kuduthu poiduva aana apporoma unna yaaru yenga adipanga nu yenake theriyadhu"" . 

I want to leave this country soon. 

Thanks for all the support and ideas. 

Seeing your comments gave me support that what i was doing was right (going to police etc). 

Also, not all reddit advise is accurate. Please consult an acutal criminal lawyer and take him with you to the station if something like this happems to you. 

I was lucky they were admk and not dmk as if it was dmk there would have been no chance to get anything. As they are current ruling party. 

Also also, fuck that IMart i hope they crash and burn. 

Peace.

1i9ixwv,chennai,Why non hindi speakers are being discriminated even in abroad?,"24F doing masters in canada. Backstory: i was excited about going abroad and have some multicultural exposure, but most of them were Indians in my class. To give a rough idea, 80% only Indians and 20% other races (it’s a top university in Canada). Part of me was happy that i have company and there won’t be any racism but honestly i was left out while having conversation or making plans, 50% are from north India and the language they prefer speaking is hindi and 30% are telugu. The part which pissed me off was when we had a common group for university admits, some people started creating “gujarati group” “ Punjabi group” “Telugu group” and no one stepped up to create tamil group (glad they didn’t).

I am working in a well known shoe brand as part time sales associate. Indian people mostly come to me speaking in hindi. I politely tell them “Sorry, i don’t speak hindi. Is there anything i can help you with?” Few switch to english, few just walk away left me hanging and most people take it as offensive. Some give me weird looks, some try to question about my ethnicity like “where i am from” and “what language i speak”. There was one time a punjabi guy started having conversation in Punjabi with me. I simply told him that i don’t understand him, he asked me if i speak hindi and i told that i don’t speak hindi either. He asked my whereabouts, where i am from. When i said south india, chennai. His response was “why south indians are so ignorant and not take any initiative to learn hindi”. I got so mad, since i am working i just laughed it off. It happened same with few more people complaining south indians don’t speak hindi. I am in canada(which is clearly English speaking country) why do i have to learn hindi to feel included? Is anyone facing similar problem? What is your opinion on this matter? 
I am not trying to show any hatred against any community, just shared what i am facing. ",694,303,1737795238,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1i9ixwv/why_non_hindi_speakers_are_being_discriminated/

The thing is I go for running at the ICF constable road (yes, the mini forest kinda road).

1hispa8,chennai,Yesterday was the darkest night of my life.,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this. But I need to get this off my chest and hope for at least a little while of sleep.  


Yesterday I came back home from work (Zoho) after rampaging through multiple shops in OMR food street, handed over the parcel I've brought with me to my wife and was about to change my dress when the bell rang multiple times.  

I opened the door. The neighbour akka was standing franctically saying there's an emergency: police had called her and informed that anna(her husband) has met with an accident and she needs to get to Chromepet GH as soon as possible. I understood she's in panic and immediately assured her we can start inmediately nu. She left her daughter (around 3 yrs old) with my wife asked her to take care of her until she's back. We (she, her dad and myself) started immediately in my car. 

Before I started my car, I called my wife and asked her to pray for good odds. I'm largely an atheist but I don't know why I did this. Maybe out of desparation. 

Anyway akka was clearly in panic mode, but she was asking uncle (her dad) to be strong and kept saying it again and again. I assured them nothing would have happened and that we are praying for her, be bold nu and all. Frankly I have no fucking clue how to comfort a person in such a situation. 

I performed my rashest driving ever, blinking the headlights throughout the drive and honking at every vehicle. I forgot all road etiquittes, all that was in my mind is to reach hospital as soon possible and give them some mental peace after seeing anna. If any of you were driving in GST and saw a white baleno honking and zooming through unapologetically - yes I was that dickhead. 

I just kept saying whatever the injury is, we can get him transferred to Rela and start good treatment apdinu. They felt hopeful after I said this. Once I entered the chromepet GH gate, akka and uncle couldn't contain themselves, asked me to stop, quickly got off the car and went to meet a friend who was already standing there.  

I parked, and as I was getting off I saw an ambulance cruise through straight into the hospital. 

All of us started running behind the vehicle. The friend was running first, followed by me and akka and her father were behind me.  

To my surprise the vehicle instead of stopping at Casuality went past it and stopped somewhere else. That was the moment I panicked. I stopped running. The ""friend"" anna came back running and said to me that he's no-more and begged me to stop akka and uncle from reaching the vehicle.  

I started running back and held both of them. I lost control and started crying, which panicked them even more. Akka started losing her strength. Her legs couldn't support her anymore, while she repeatedly asked me what happened what happened nu. Uncle was even more in shock and started shouting anna's name loudly. Akka fainted in a while and we helped carry her and placed her in a chair, while uncle just sat on floor near akka's legs still shouting anna's name.  

Witnessing this is definitely one of my darkest moments. And I realized how helpless I'm to them at that moment. There is nothing in this world that I can say to them or do that will piece them back again, And that helplessness that I felt - I still can't shrug it off. I mean, I've lived life as if everything is in my control and for the first time there we all were, where everything that could have gone wrong had went wrong. And there was nothing that I could do about it. I've never felt so powerless, useless and ashamed of myself. 

I don't want to get more into the details but I just sat there with them for the next 2-3 hours witness how a person looses touch with reality when such extreme personal events occur. 

Both of them didn't even remember what happened, how they came to the hospital or anything. All they were requesting for the next several hours was to see anna and take him to a different hospital and I'd just keep saying the doctor has asked us to wait nu. In reality there was no fucking doctor. There was nobody asking us to wait. I had to lie. Straight to his face and akka's face. And that was the most hurtful lie I had to say to control them from breaking away from me and running to the ambulance that was parked near mortuary. I had zero idea how to handle this situation, but I had to pull myself together for akka's sake and uncle's sake. And their daughter. I burst into crying whenever his 3 yr old daughter came to my mind but I had to hide it to calm down akka and uncle.  

This world is brutal. We think there's some logic and sense into how things work. But there isn't. This universe makes no fucking sense and I felt it through my bone yesterday.  

Anyway the next few hours until their relatives started arriving, those will be my darkest moments of life. I'm doing ok now, but I still can't comprehend how the family is taking it. Their daughter is the cutest little innocent angel I've ever seen. How cruel should the universe be to assign this fate to such a beautiful angel. I mean this makes no fucking sense at all.

So last evening I was driving from Nungambakkam to Anna Nagar, near the Anna Arch with the usual Sunday evening traffic. One  2-wheeler decided to speed run through traffic and to his dismay my car was in his way to glory. 

With the usual wrong side driving on left side of the road I wasn’t going to take any chances so I waited till the car in front to give way for me to drive through. The biker got mad that I was holding him back and tried to wedge between my car and other car on my right. He was too close to mine and grazed the rear view mirror slightly, I honked and I rolled down the window to tell him to be mindful. He got triggered and started hurling abuses at me. I was in shock at what did I even say wrong. 

Now comes the best part, as he was spewing out verbal vomit he tried speeding up as I moved my car near him. He hit the auto in front of him and broke the brake light while he was turning back to showcase his verbal skills to me. Auto driver came out grabbed his shirt and ottaaru paarunga onnu leftla. Mushroom mandayan was stunned with shock as I passed him with a giddy smile on my face waving at him. It was priceless.

1gu5jcc,chennai,"Denied Access to Lingerie Shopping at Saravana Stores, Chennai: A Cultural Adventure","Hey folks,
Born and raised in the Middle East, now living in the UK, I’ve always had a casual approach to shopping during my visits to India. But today, I stumbled into a cultural minefield that left me both confused and amused.

Picture this: my girlfriend asked me to pick up some lingerie for her because “it’s way cheaper here.” Being the supportive partner I am, I decided to grab some boxers for myself and, of course, her requested items.

With AirPods in and vibes on point, I confidently asked a few store employees for directions to the women’s lingerie section. They smiled, pointed me in the right direction, and I thought, Easy peasy.

But no. As soon as I walked into the section, with upbeat music playing in the background, three women dashed toward me like I’d walked into a restricted government facility. They physically stopped me and said, “Sir, you cannot enter here!”

What now?

Apparently, men are banned from the lingerie section—it’s exclusively for women. This, despite the fact that I’m shopping for someone else! Mind you, I’ve been to stores in Saudi Arabia where it’s way more conservative!, and even they allow this. My dad and I used to shop under garments for my mom and sister back in the day without a second thought!

So, here I am, flabbergasted, wondering what sort of taboo I just stepped into. India’s a paradox, isn’t it? Bollywood has the boldest moves, but lingerie shopping? Apparently, that’s sacred ground.

Can someone please explain this? Am I missing some deep cultural wisdom, or was today just a comedy of errors?

What do you think?

Edit 1 : To every genius asking why I went to the store - unlike you, I’m not local and don’t know the standards of where to shop from etc. I just wanted cheap under garments because we’re looking to dispose them every month after using them due to personal reasons. Now, buying anywhere else would be waste, so I was looking to spend less money for one time use and throw inner wear for my gf and I. Secondly, rickshaw anna said things are cheap and in abundance there. Thirdly, I’ve seen their ads so many times that it run a bell and I just went in without thinking twice. 

Edit 2 : why is it Chennai filled with 75% of stupid people and 25% of rational people? I hope it evens out at some point at least. Please scroll down and read all the comments. It’s literally filled with people who want to talk about everything apart from the main question asked.

1jdp1ql,chennai,Why do Indian weddings feel like a punishment?!,"I hate weddings. It's never about the couple. It's about their parents, their egos, and their desperate need to flex how much money they torched on this over-the-top spectacle.

Most so-called “well-wishers”? They don’t actually care. They show up because they got an invite, not because they’re genuinely happy for you. Half are just there for the food, and the other half? Fresh gossip. Honestly, even if you flew them out to an Ambani wedding, they'd still find something to complain about.

Then there’s the dreaded reception, standing for hours, fake-smiling at 500 strangers who are somehow very important to your parents. Taking endless pictures, pretending to know people you’ve never met while they bless you with unsolicited life advice.

And of course, the screaming children. Running around the hall like it's a racetrack, bumping into guests, knocking over drinks.  Meanwhile, their parents? Conveniently nowhere to be found. They treat weddings like a free daycare center.

Tying the knot takes place at the ass crack of dawn. You get 0 sleep after the reception and you need to look your best for the wedding, great! 

And let’s not forget the financial disaster. Your parents literally take out loans for a two-day circus. And as if that's not enough, after the wedding, you’re dragged on a post-marriage scavenger hunt, visiting every so-called ""close"" relative’s house to collect blessings. Oh, and there’s the inevitable temple visit, to a temple nobody remembers until wedding day, located in some remote village that takes five hours to reach.

By the end of it, the bride and groom don’t look like a happily married couple; they look like hostages. And the bride? Good luck getting her makeup done without 7,492 relatives barging in with their expert opinions.

Oh, and the outfits. The sarees, lehengas, suits, and blazers, so flashy that you can’t wear them to another event without upstaging everyone. So, congrats! You just spent a fortune on a one-time-use outfit.

Honestly, weddings are just stress, debt, and drama wrapped in marigolds and gold jewelry.

I had to get this off my chest because I don’t want a wedding. I’d rather just sign the marriage certificate, have a small dinner with close friends, and let my parents keep the money they saved for me. But convincing them? That’s the real challenge.

I think about this every day because my parents expect me to marry at 26. I’m 24. And me not being ready for marriage? That’s a whole other rant for another day.

If you love big weddings, go for it. But I just wish they weren’t the default expectation, especially when they leave families drowning in debt.

Hi guys your friendly neighbourhood chettan here. I WAS FUCKED! AND THATS A FUCKING UNDERSTATEMENT. 2023 I gave my bike, a thunderbird 500 for service in RE Perungudi service centre as I hadn’t ridden for quite a while. This is where I my biggest mistake ever in Chennai, I trusted those motherfuckers. I left my bike and I had to leave to Kerala. Two weeks passed getting no updates I called the guy who was assigned my bike and I had to send him around 5k for some industrial work on my bike and then it all went haywire. So I’m back in Chennai after a month and a half and still the bike ain’t ready. After a few more weeks (I guess 3) I get my bike back and wow the bill is above 33000. THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MYRU. Let’s do some math, not meth… Math! 33K + 5K + surprise they fucked over my battery too. 40,000 PLUS RUPEES SPENT and yeah I have the bills too (I paid btw). DOES THE BIKE RUN SMOOTHLY? They made that shit undriveable. I fucking made a scene and they said I need to do work for 16 k more. Ommale kiss my ass. The workers started getting worried as customers were also there and they sure as hell didn’t want to lose any potential prey. One mf was kinda like squaring up to me as if he wanted to fight, I remember he’s in his 40’s and has gray hair. Everything was only calmed down because there was one guy de-escalating the situation. I took my bike and left as I knew these retards ain’t gon do shit. 

IMPORTANT: They claimed the bike needs to run a bit and will take a week to adjust. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. THEYRE TRYING TO VOID YOUR 1 WEEK SERVICE WARRANTY. 

I noticed this a day after and my bike gave 10kmpl literally and was stalling every 10 metres and it drank 3 liters of petrol from Adyar to sholinganellur and it died there on my way to my place I left it there, went home, sent emails to every REtard official in the south and it was a Sunday. Obviously no reply. I contacted my friend who’s a lawyer and I sent the addresses that I will be filing a complaint in the consumer court for deficiency in service and fraud. And viola I got a response within 10 minutes. They took my bike the next day itself. I talked around and asked around to know the situation of that place and wtf is happening. 

An ex employee gave me something vital. 

VERY IMPORTANT : 

1. THE PARTS THEY SWAP FROM YOUR BIKE STATING THEY REPLACED IT ARE OFTEN SOLD TO OTHERS OR THEY USE IT THEMSELVES IF THEY HAVE A SIMILAR BIKE. 

2. THE PEOPLE WORKING ON YOUR BIKE GETS A COMMISSION OF THE TOTAL WORK THEY DO AND THEIR MONTHLY WAGE IS ARSE. 

3. IF YOUR BIKE HAS WARRANTY, YOU CAN EXPECT SOME PARTS TO BE GONE. 

4. idk how much of this is true but, SINCE COVID MOST PRE-EXISTENT SERVICE CENTRES ARE AT HUGE LOSSES AND WILL RIP YOU OFF.  

Took a week to finally “fix” my bike still the bike was in a bad condition. Some fucker claiming to some biggie of the branch showed up and started apologising and I made the mistake of calming down. I’m not mentioning his name because I do not remember his name, I don’t want someone else getting framed and I won’t give 2 flying fucks about exposing shit like him as he’s one of those fucks that steals parts for his interceptor from ones that come in (I got to find this out too). He asked me for 20k…… THIS MOTHERFUCKER’S AUDACITY! I GAVE HIM HELL. I got my bike rolled outta there with 40 something thousand missing from my pocket. It would’ve been 60 or even more.

1lo1122,chennai,Worst train experience ever from Chengalpattu — people seriously have zero boundaries,"So this is honestly the worst lack of basic boundaries I’ve ever seen. We took the local train from Chengalpattu to Chennai, bought **first class** t i c \* k e t s, paid for it fair and square — me, my dad, my mom, and my grandma (our aaya). We were all dressed perfectly fine — I’m in a T-shirt, pants, shoes, my mom and grandma in sarees, my dad in formals. No way in hell do we look poor or like we couldn’t afford it.

We had exactly two suitcases, one big and one small. And mind you, the train wasn’t even full — there were plenty of seats, even if someone wanted to lie down.

The moment we got into the coach, people started acting like some self-appointed t i c \* k e t inspectors, going *“this is first class, you need a t i c \* k e t.”* Like WTF? We HAVE a t i c \* k e t. And you’re not even the TC, why are you policing me? My dad literally showed them the t i c \* k e t, but still, every station a new group got on and pulled the same shit.

Are these people brain-dead? At one point my dad lost his cool because this one random lady straight-up asked my mom to get up and told her *“don’t you know this is first class?”* Like, are these fuckers so privileged that they think traveling in first class makes them superior gods or something?

We didn’t want to take the car because of evening traffic, but holy hell this was worse. And on top of that, people were just *gawking* at my mom for no reason, like she’s some rare zoo animal. She’s in her 40s, fair-skinned, but why the hell does that give random creeps the right to stare at her like that?

This entire journey of about 1.5 hours was absolute hell. Seriously, why do people care so much about what you wear, what t i c \* k e t you hold, how you look, and why can’t they mind their own goddamn business?

Honestly one of the worst experiences of public transport in Chennai. Had to get this off my chest.

I think she believes that i am supporting my dad just cuz he has money but i am not.I have asked him many times about this issue and he tells me that my mother is completely imagining this,i feel he is a lost cause.After my mother’s suicide attempt two months ago he has left the house and is living alone.He comes and visits me and my brother twice in a week.

1m2xxt3,chennai,Why is no one talking about how far behind Tamil students are compared to other states?,"This is a severe problem that literally no one is talking about. Not DMK, ADMK, BJP, TVK, NTK, etc.  
  
The fact of the matter is that to determine the future of a state/country, the learning outcomes achieved by your youth is perhaps the most important and vital statistic. Sure, we are getting more manufacturing and investing more in school infrastructure, but we are seriously lagging behind in outcomes. States like Bihar and UP who have far less educational infrastructure than we do are outperforming our kids.

We can complain about neet as much as we want to, but if we can't even teach our kids basic arithmetic then this is a problem.

And what's even more concerning is that since 2018 we have actually been getting worse and worse. For instance, in 2018 we were the **fourth** highest amongst all of the states in ""STD VIII Arithmetic"" (last image) but in 2024 **we don't even make the top 10**.

Countries like China were able to develop not only because of manufacturing but because of excellent education to the point where a 8th standard kid not being able to do division would be considered a sign of mental retardation. But in TN this comprises the majority of students.

And for those of you who think that these statistics are false -- I don't think so. My uncle is a gov school teacher and he 100% agrees with all of these stats -- there are so many students in 8th standard who cannot even read a simple sentence in Tamil or English.   
  
We complain about not wanting to teach Hindi loudly, turn it into a massive issue, and talk proudly about our language, but when the majority of our kids aren't even being taught the basics of Tamil properly, what is the use?

This does not bode well at all. If this continues, we can forget about any sort of economic progress and escaping the ""middle-income trap"". And dumb populist politics will never ease up. How can you convince someone that GDP per capita is important when they were never even taught division.

Education is the grease that makes society run and we are lacking in it.

I was thinking about starting some sort of foundation or state-wise initiative where we can have volunteers try and help gov school kids who are seriously lagging behind catch up but I don't know how feasible this is and I don't know if I will have time also.

1m7qcp5,chennai,"Keezhadi, Samathuvam, and a Call to the CM Helpline! Small Actions Matter!","  
**TL;DR:**  
In Jan 2025, saw govt school girls made to sit on the floor at Keezhadi Museum. Filed a complaint with the TN CM Helpline. Two months later, got a memo, policy changed. Kudos to TN Govt for listening and acting. Delhi may ignore Keezhadi, but Tamil Nadu still walks the talk on social justice.  


In January 2025, we visited the Keezhadi Arungatchiyagam (museum)that now houses artifacts unearthed from the Keezhadi excavation.

If you haven’t been, go. It's not just a museum; it’s a reclamation of memory. A declaration and living proof that Tamil history didn’t begin with saffron-washed North Indian textbooks.

The museum is well-designed, the artifacts awe-inspiring, and the screening experience genuinely impressive. And it was clean and well kept. Surprise oh Surprise!

But something happened that day that I couldn’t ignore.

A group of school girls from local government schools were brought in to watch the screening. Once the seats filled up with public and some of the girls, the rest were asked to sit on the ground.

On the floor. In the same Keezhadi that symbolizes equality, literacy, urban sophistication, industrialization and Samathuvam.

For a state that prides itself on its social justice ethos, this was jarring to me....

Maybe it was unintentional with no bias. But we were in Madurai(not casting any light) Maybe the auditorium wasn’t prepared for that many students.

**But context matters.**

Seating a certain group of government school girls, on the ground while others remain in chairs sends a message, even if nobody says it aloud.

I raised it then and there. We spoke to the teachers, to the staff, to the organizers. Nothing changed. So we left and we did what we believe every concerned citizen should do:

**I called the CM Helpline. I registered a complaint.**

**We said that Keezhadi, of all places, should not let this happen.**

Two months later, I got a SMS. Then a letter. And a photocopy of a memo - attached.

The memo had been issued by the CM Cell to the State Archaeological Department, recommending that such seating practices be discontinued. That steps be taken to ensure dignified, equal treatment of all visitors , especially children.

*Let that sink in.*

*A complaint was registered.*

*It was acknowledged.*

*And it led to an actual change in policy.*

*That’s the Tamil Nadu I believe in.*

One where Samathuvam is not a marketing slogan, but a living principle: flawed, evolving, but moving in the right direction.

One where even a lone complaint from a random citizen can ripple into institutional change.

I have to commend the CM’s office and the TN government for not brushing this aside, but choosing instead to listen and act.

Now, to the elephant in the room.

Yes, Keezhadi is still being suppressed at the national level. The full findings haven’t been published. Delhi still drags its feet because the truth of Keezhadi doesn’t fit the story they want to tell. A story where civilization only flows from the north. A story where Tamil is a regional tongue, not the ancient voice of a sophisticated, industrial, egalitarian, urban society.

But this post isn’t about Delhi.

This is about us.

About what we do differently.

About why this land, despite all its flaws, still knows how to course-correct.

Keezhadi tells us who we were, and this incident shows what we are becoming!

And when the CM cell acts on a simple citizen complaint to ensure schoolchildren aren’t made to sit on the floor in a state-run auditorium, that tells me who we still are - and who we’re becoming.

Hello. I have a friend from Chennai who is a 19 year old girl.
She has been battling severe cancer (Cardiac Angiosarcoma), and cardiovascular illness for 7 months, but i have run out of money to pay for her treatment. 

She is unable to get public health insurance, because her family income is too high, but her family does not care about her. 

Her mother abuses drugs all day, is physically abusive, and has said, she does not care if she dies. The step dad is both physically and sexually abusive.

She is currently at the Adyar Cancer Institute, which is a charity hospital, but the chemotherapy and radiation costs over 50.000 rupees a week, which i can’t afford. She has no family, or close friends that are willing to support her.

Her sister has called up many charities and hospitals, but no one is willing to help.

 Should she really die, because of having a horrible family, and bureaucracy standing in the way?

I am not Indian, and don’t know, what i can do. I have tried 
searching for jobs, loaning money, but there are no options left.

Is there anything we can do?
And mods, please don’t delete this post.

Our airport is a mess and doesn’t even come close to what other major cities have. Meanwhile, other states are building massive ports, pushing ahead with export capabilities while we’re getting left behind. When it comes to our roads, we don’t even have a proper expressway plan, which is honestly a shame.

The Chennai Metro is one positive thing we have going, but the pace at which it's expanding? It’s like watching paint dry. We need that metro system up and running faster to actually make a difference for the city.

The worst part is seeing political parties take an anti-infrastructure stance. Why are we so afraid of investing in our future? This kind of opposition is only going to hold us back even more.

And honestly, the whole romantic idea of “we need more farmers and more farmland” is outdated. We don’t need to keep adding farmers or clearing land when advanced farming methods can produce more with less. Look at European countries; they’re 1/10th the size of India but export way more than we do.

But back home in Tamil Nadu, we're stuck with Tasmac’s garbage-tier liquor. Even the so-called “Elite” Tasmac outlets serve up swill I wouldn’t use to clean my bathroom. It’s a joke.

If the government privatized Tasmac and enforced some decent quality standards, they’d rake in way more cash. Every state in India leans on alcohol revenue—it’s just how it is. But Tamil Nadu’s unique mess comes from the state running Tasmac while politicians pull the strings behind the scenes, controlling the entire supply chain including bottling plants, breweries and logistics to pad their own pockets. They push their own cheap, terrible brands, and the system stays rotten.

This setup screws everyone. The government misses out on more tax revenue, and we’re left choking down subpar booze that probably takes years off our lives. The people lose, plain and simple.

I’d love to see the ED grow some fucking balls and nail these bastards—lock up that slimy piece of shit Senthil Balaji for good. That asshole turned everything he touched into crap, from transport under AIADMK to electricity later on. But let’s be real, the ED(read as BJP) will probably just cut a deal with DMK and call it a day. No hope there.

1fa3izm,chennai,PVR - an unworthy imposition ,"PVR is a bane to cinema viewers in our country. They've become a monopoly, absorbing, Spi, Inox, Jazz and whatnot. Their services are pathetic and maintenance is laughable. You pay hundreds and go sit in a life size screen in Sathyam, and you'll see grains of dust all over the screen and ruin your viewing experience. 

Their ad culture is seriously over the line. In aerohub, they run ads for literally 20-25 mins and it definitely kills the mood. In addition, they've removed all privilege programs. Now, you'll get nothing for watching from your favourite screens because they know, ""where else you'll go?""

Their Passport program is a straight up scam. Try and book one first day release on a weekday, and you will never be able to use it. Shitty group looting using their leverage.

Oh, and their popcorn. My dear lord, I remember buying a bucket of popcorn at Rs. 380/- at SPI back in 2019. Now the biggest size you get is large and the prices are ridiculous, around 600-650. No amount of inflation can justify this price hike. Taste? Feels like you are eating soaked cardboard. I've stopped buying popcorn , once SPI was replaced with PVR. I've also heard that they charge for toppings nowadays, and butter is not refillable too. Gone are the days, where people would cue up around seasoning stalls and show their shaking skills. They just are set to a mentality, because we people have no choice but to come to their screens and consume whatever they claim as ""food"". And they are also right in a way. Some movies, we can only watch at PVR. IMAX releases? we are at the mercy of PVR.

That's why I've switched to local theatres, for most of the times. And only go to PVR for unavoidable viewings. Like IMAX, Other language releases. These local theatres are far better, has better sound quality, maintenance and importantly, they sell their food at prices that seem reasonable comparatively. I feel pity for people who enters the screen with kids and tubs of popcorn. That's money actually down the drain, but they have no choice. PVR have been shoving their inedible food and good for nothing service down our throats right royally for years now.

Everytime I sit in a PVR screen, I am filled with rage, when I see their logo running, because they did nothing but becoming a mindless monopoly, capitalising the shit out of this industry. And they've ruined the viewing experience of every single cinema enthusiasts and I'll never ever forgive them for it (and for taking away SPI cinemas from us).

I secretly pray for their downfall every single time I'm in one of their screens. And I hope it happens soon.

1m3mpho,chennai,Got followed around and harassed by an auto driver,"TW: Curse words

Ik you're all tired of hearing the same thing but still listen to this, I got down at the potheri railway station this morning at 6.30, an auto driver came up to me and I told him ""Smiles PG TRS ponum na"" and he directed me to this other driver and i again told him ""smiles pg TRS ponum"" and he was asleep in his auto so this first auto guy came and called him and he woke up and asked me ""enga ponum"" I said ""TRS, smiles pg"" and he said ""150rs agum"" I said fine since that's the usual fare. 

Fast forward, he took me on another route and I told him ""en na ipdi poringa TRS main road laye pona pakkan thana"" and SUDDENLY this guy is like ""TRS ah? Maa PG thana soninga"" and I'm like ""enaku apdi oru pg eh theriyathu, TRS tha sonne"" and hes like ""TRS na 200 ma"" and i just sternly told him ""mudiyathu na, 150 nu solli ethitu 200 kekathinga"" and we had an argument back and forth but I told him I'll only pay 150 and it's a straight road from here to TRS anyway so it was still reasonable to me. 

On our way I asked him to stop at a tea shop for a min and he just bluntly said ""nikka mudiyathu"" , my phone ran out of power and i only had 600rs in cash (a 500 and a 100 note), so I told him ""illa na engita 500 ruba tha iruku na change vaanganum"" and then he's like ""illa na change tharen ma"" (in a snarky tone) and i kept telling him no and got down the auto to go get change and he immediately went ""atha na change tharen nu solren la, ne anga irunth trs ku 150rs la poiruviya, ethiruvangala unna"" atp i got scared so i just took my luggage off and told him ""neenga 150 soninga innu pg la drop panala, 100rs tharen, na inga erangikuren"" and then this fucker, kept following me around for the next 500mtrs saying ""paithiya kaara koothi en usure vangave vanthiya punda mavale"" ""ne laam paduka tha college vanthuruka""  and SO MANY other explicit and offensive stuff about me and MY family?!. which i didn't hear properly cuz I had my headphones on.

First thing in the morning! i haven't even called my parents and told them I've reached and this is what i was hearing, he kept yelling all these stuff, driving his auto slow and following me until I reached a tea shop nearby and he stopped his auto there and STILL kept yelling. This is just straight up harassment and I still can't believe this happened, a washed out 40yr old mf fighting a college student is insane. Genuinely where tf do these people get so much audacity from, acting like they run this place or whatever. I wouldn't have minded paying him 200rs had this fucker known how to talk politely instead of going around demanding money like I owe him or something. All this for just 1.5km. I hope he hits himself in his auto somewhere and something bad happens.

EDIT: For the ones saying, use Ola, Rapido or take a photo of the auto, pls remember that my phone was switched off which is why I couldn't gpay and had to get down to get change for the 500rsn:)

It really aches to come back to Chennai and see the Cooum -- a river that just serves as a giant drainage canal. There's so much potential there. Imagine if it were clean, navigable, and actually added to the city's vibe instead of being avoided.

I know there are real challenges — especially relocating people living along the banks — but this is something that’s been due for decades.

1jdl5tp,chennai,"Dear men, how do you deal with this feeling?","Long text ahead.

23M

How do you deal with the sudden feeling of needing a life partner?

Please don’t get me wrong , am a very modest/sober guy, never had a girlfriend so far. But got influenced too much from love Movies that came out in the last decade, I used to fantasised a romantic life all my school life. An innocent thought of an avg 90s kid, early 2k kid is after school, we join college, have our own mobile, get a bike and all these things will lead to getting a lover. I had the same mindset as well, spent my all of my school days in a same school with a same set of 5 guy friends and 3 crushes from baby class to 12th. I just kept looking at those crushed and never approached them, as I had this fixed mindset of having lover only after school (there was actually no pressure but somehow I used to think like that) below average in studies, got 74% in class 12.

Joined a college, took CA by side and started my new phase of life in 2019, new friends, freedom to roam around the city with college friends, having a regular cash flow of atleast ₹100 with me, my own mobile phone, scrolling reels in the last bench, bunking classes and watching films, chilling at Marina, life was good in my 1st year.

But never touched cigarette & alcohol till day, but I had couple of other friends like me tried how the experience is, and that’s it never went back. 

2020 hit like a mountain, lockdown happened and mental health dropped. Wanted to focus in studies but had this one female friend whom I liked very much and somehow developed feelings for her, but she kept fantasising the men from Korean & Turkish dramas, I was no where near to them, so I was flexible enough to let go the feelings. 

And then the batman trend, fight club trend, world war movies & TV series started entering into my life and my mindset was modelled very differently from then on. I started to look out for myself, build a fit physique, groom well, communicate well etc. Business & finance movies played a major role too I want to get a high paying finance job and started to learn skills required for the same. Spent a couple of years like that. And still maintained good relationship with my 4 male friends and 2 female friends.

And lately I started to feel more connected towards my family and , and  became very spiritual which was not a case in my school & college days, I thought they’re pampering me and blocking me from having fun.

I respect my brother very much nowadays, I look up to him like a dad, involving a lot in family events & functions, coming from a very connected & traditional family.

Now am doing my final year articleship at a CA firm, been 3 years since I completed my college & joined this office, I earn 8K a month as a stipend and I study regularly to clear my exams. 

The past three was very much monotonous, no social life and having a same type of day for three years. My mind is changed, I want to earn a lot give it back to my family, take care of my dad & mom.

Am an over-thinker, and recently I had a conversation with a colleague about cancer treatment and stuff, this topic came out of nowhere we were talking about something else and landed up here. He said his relative passed away couple of years ago due to cancer and he was talking about chemotherapy & stuff. 

Idk what happened to me but suddenly I started to think about my parents, rushed towards my study desk and started reading. I was a different experience all together that I faced for the first time.

Later I gave myself a pat on the back that am on a right path. 

Soo what’s the catch? 

Sometimes I get hit with this feeling of needing someone beside me, someone to walk with me, someone with whom I can give my utmost attention and unconditional love. My palm & fingers are anxious to tie hands with someone I love. 

I get a fomo watching couples. When this feeling hits I go zoned out. How do you guys deal with this and dear women what do you think about someone like me? Does this kind of a guy will get married and capable of running a family with you?

Thank you very much for reading till this.

1j7d5ha,chennai,I had a mix-of-emotion kind of an experience today....did I do the right thing?,"I 20M am going through a lot. Like a series of bad events happening for the past few months.

I just thought of taking a break and explore the city. I eventually roamed around Parrys corner and ended up in Marina Beach and Chepauk. From Chepauk I thought of taking metro from Government Estate and go home....

On my way, some old poor aunty came to me crying and was like ""oru phone pannanum pa"". I was worried if she was one of the person who takes your phone away and runs. I made sure no one suspicious enough was nearby and asked her to type the number. She said that she wasn't educated and can't define numbers.

So I just asked her to tell the number and she recited it. I typed, made the call and gave her. Someone picks up and she starts crying and starts screaming at the other person on the call....then after 2 minutes she ends/cuts the call and gives it to me and starts crying again. Starts murmuring something. I didn't understand a bit but I knew that she was in distress. 

I felt sorry for her and asked if she wants something to drink. She cried that she got no money. I told that I'll get her the drink. Eventually got her a Slice (that sugary mango drink) 20 rupees bottle and she drank it in a jiffy.

I then took her to a biryani spot nearby and got her a chicken biryani. While eating she was crying about how she raised her son with all her might, she even sold her house in her hometown to help him grow. She had a small home in Chennai, her son made her sell it for some money. Eventually he took the money and duped her and now she had nowhere to go. Not even some money to go to her hometown....

She are only half plate biryani and she wanted the other half packed for dinner. 

When we came out of the biryani place, she asked me to place a call to her son again. This time it looked like he blocked my number. So she gave me another number (she had it in a paper). Someone picked the call and she started bashing them on call. 

She again gave the phone back and thanked me. I asked if I can take her via metro and drop her at CMBT so she can take a bus. She said no need even after I told that I'll get her a ticket. It looked like she wanted to come with me, but she was hesitant. 

At the end, I ended up giving 500 rupees to her and said ""it's from my first salary, please use it to go home"" (it was actually from my first stipend). She started crying again and said ""nalla varuva paa nee"" and started falling on my legs. I jumped back. Gave her some confidence that good time is coming.

Lastly she asked ""een veedu vandhudum la paa"" and I confidently said yes. She thanked me, and left the premises crying. Everyone were looking at us for what she did.

While coming back it felt good. Like the first good thing that happened in months. I was having the worst time possible in my life and I was glad that a part of my first stipend was put to good use. 

But I'm confused if I did the right thing by giving her the money? What if she was an S-Class actor for such things. I literally spent 600 out of my 5000 on this 😭.

I hope the money was used in right place. And please take 5 seconds of your time and pray for her. I believe in prayers. I hope she gets her home back somehow. And hopefully my shit gets fixed too 😞

1fkmlat,chennai,Kora Food Street Scam along with unreasonable pricing of briyani all over Chennai ,"There is a scam running in and around Chennai in the name of 24*7 food Street. Everyday especially on weekend it's crowded like a festival but problem is that all the food items right from shawarma to briyani is over priced to the roof without A/C ( which is bare minimum in Chennai) they call it as a food Street but the ventilation is 0 without that Giant fans

I understand people are treating that place as a get together event still🤦

Adding to this briyani all over Chennai taste like a tomato rice but the price starts from like 250+

For example in same Velachery only place where I felt it's good briyani is in Junior Kuppanna but that chicken briyani cost almost 300(don't remember the exact price though). And there is one more called Amman mess with a queue but the briyani is full of oil or whatever with reasonable price and less quantity 

There is another restaurant called Rasavid behind pheonix mall which sells all the food overpriced but taste is below par. Most of the restaurants running it with good decoration but not good food (which should have been the 1st priority)

And there is another briyani shop endorsed by our own T.Natarajan and their restaurant is full of bright light but food taste like a pure sand ⏳ 

One restaurant not even one restaurant has good food with reasonable price in Chennai.. wherever you go they will have beautiful decoration and excellent service but the food taste is below par

They claimed they could get me into any MNC or service-based company I wanted  no real interviews, just a few formalities. The pitch? ""We have tie-ups with HRs in top companies. You just pay us, and we’ll get you in.""

The office looked new, but something felt off. It was on the second floor of a two-storey building, above a catering company. The receptionist was unusually young and didn’t look trained. Inside, there were rooms labeled “Operations” and “Management,” but clearly, no one was inside those rooms except for one “interview” room.

I was told to fill a basic form with my personal info and degree details. A woman (named Devi) then pitched the full scam — ₹30,000 upfront for “mid-tier” companies, ₹1,00,000 for MNCs. She said the interviews will be done online, and they'll even tell us the answers.

When I asked for real company names, success stories, or any proof, she got uncomfortable. No transparency. No documentation. Just vague promises and a generic ""ISO-certified agreement"" with no details.

Even the building security had no clue how long this place has been there. Locals said it’s only been around for a year, despite them claiming 8-15 years of operation.

Everything screamed “scam.”

If you’re job hunting in Chennai please be careful. If someone promises a job with no effort, guaranteed placement, and demands money up front, it’s almost always a scam.

The problem with them is the sheer amount of fumes they produce. It becomes hellish to stand wait in traffic when one is nearby.

How come these autos are still allowed to run? I'm not trying to come off as a saint but it really bothers me how much pollution these things are causing in the long term.

Could the government not offer a scheme wherein these autos can be traded in for an amount appropriate to buy a cheap 4 stroke unit?

Between 2023 and 2024, Chennai's metropolitan population increased by approximately **278,000 people**, growing from **11,776,000** in 2023 to **12,054,000 (1.2 crores)** in 2024. This represents an annual growth rate of about **2.36%.** With space running out, high-rises and integrated smart townships may dominate the skyline. Based on current trends, Chennai's population in 2049 is likely to be in the range of  18 million or 1.8 crores in the metropolitan area.

I ask you, people of Chennai. How can we make a similar decision made in Delhi, but better?




What probably will happen is, there won’t be enough space for the dogs taken off the streets and it’ll be used as an excuse to cull them.



Is it possible to prevent reproduction of a dog by neutering, and tagging it? So instead of wasting space by holding dogs in inhumane conditions, can we neuter them and let the stray population slowly die out from natural causes? I’m genuinely curious if this approach is possible



Not just dogs, I’d love cows from the streets to go the same way



For stray lovers: please don’t be swayed by emotion for dogs. You haven’t seen a person with rabies fully set in. It’ll haunt you



You haven’t seen a literal child mauled by a pack of dogs. It’ll haunt you



You haven’t seen a stray dog mother starve so much, it eats its the weakest of its offspring




You don’t know how expensive it is for a rabies vaccine, and how much a dog bite hurts 




You haven’t seen a stray dog hit by a car lie dead on the road, covered in flies and shit, and run over and over again till it becomes a part of the roads structural integrity



You haven’t seen a car accident caused by a stray dog that couldn’t decide whether to go left or right because it got scared by a large animal with two bright lights heading towards it at 60kmph



You haven’t seen dog piss and poop where people walk and eat everyday.



You haven’t seen a pack of dogs gang up and kill another dog


You don’t know what nature actually is



If you have seen any of this, and you still want strays to roam around freely, I’m sorry but you have no care neither for humans, nor strays


If you care so much, why be selective to dogs? Why not animals in slaughterhouses? Just go see 1 uncensored video of a life of a cow or chicken that will end up as meat. You are focusing on the wrong issues



If you care so much, why not take all of the strays into your house, collar them, leash them, clean up their poop when you take them outside? Can’t do that? Then do not interfere



I do not support mass culling of strays, but first and foremost, stray dogs must be thrown out of gated communities, and then the ones on the streets must eventually cease to exist, in the most humane way possible.

1gx0020,chennai,Potential Scam involving Tamil Nadu Police,"Potential Scam involving Tamil Nadu Police

So, this weird thing happened yesterday. My sister got an SMS saying she had been fined ₹1000 for driving without a helmet. The message had a reference number (or something like that) and a link to check the details. At first, I thought it might be a phishing scam, but when we checked the website (parivahan website), it looked legit. That’s where things started to get strange.

The challan was issued by Tamil Nadu Police, but we live in Kerala. Her vehicle is registered at an RTO near the Tamil Nadu border, sure, but here’s the thing—she doesn’t even know how to ride a two-wheeler. The vehicle has been sitting idle at home for at least 2-3 months, and I haven’t taken it out in forever. Plus, we haven’t even been to Tamil Nadu in years.

Another odd thing is that there were no images or proof of the so-called offense on the website. Normally, there should be some sort of evidence, right? At least, that's how I have seen things happen when challan is issued by Kerala Police.

Anyway, I asked someone we know who runs a janseva kendra. Apparently, this isn’t uncommon. The Tamil Nadu Police, according to him, have some monthly quota for issuing fines (I think KP also have them). When they can’t meet it, they are allegedly just slap random vehicle numbers with challans to make up the numbers. We were told we could challenge it, but only by going to Tamil Nadu, which is a huge hassle. Most people end up paying because it’s just not worth the time, effort, and cost to fight it.

It’s honestly frustrating that this kind of thing even happens. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Is there any way to sort it out without traveling all the way to Tamil Nadu?",295,34,1732251137,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1gx0020/potential_scam_involving_tamil_nadu_police/

While waiting for a bus in Tambaram station, she was pushed by some of those who went running to catch the bus as it stopped.

She took ₹75,000 from us for a shipment to the U.S., and since then, the communication has been either completely dishonest or nonexistent.

We haven’t even finalized or shortlisted all the products for shipment, yet she keeps repeating:
	•	“Parcel on the way”
	•	“It’s being sent in two batches”

Let’s be real — no one sends a shipment under 15 kg to the U.S. in two separate batches. It doesn’t add up.

She promised a smooth process, hounded us for the payment, and once it was made — she disappeared. The only time she responds is when something is posted online. Otherwise, she doesn’t bother replying. And when we ask for basic tracking info, she vanishes again.

To make things worse, when my business partner left a genuine review on Google to warn others, Sruthi harassed her and pressured her to take it down instead of owning up or fixing the situation.

This behavior is not only unprofessional — it’s fraudulent. If you’re considering working with Aadhambharaa or Sruthi, please be extremely cautious. We learned the hard way, and we don’t want anyone else to fall into the same trap.

Has anyone else dealt with her?

1k6pwt9,chennai,Please advise:),"Hi everyone,

I'm planning to start a small side business to earn some extra income. I currently have a flexible full-time job, so I’m looking for something that can run in the background.

After discussing with my parents, they agreed to support me by helping purchase a second-hand car, which I plan to register with a T-board. The idea is to run the vehicle through platforms like Ola, Uber, or Rapido and earn a steady monthly profit after covering expenses like the driver’s salary, fuel, and other maintenance costs.

The main challenge I’m facing is finding a trustworthy full-time driver. I reached out to a few drivers I know (like acting/on-call drivers), but I didn’t get much response. I even contacted an employment agency, but they discouraged me—saying it’s hard to find reliable drivers and that the returns might not be worth the effort.

Now I’m feeling a bit stuck and unsure whether to move forward with this plan. Has anyone here tried something similar or have any advice on how to go about it? I’d really appreciate any insights or suggestions.

Thanks in advance!

Has the TN market really lost its buying power? Or is it just a lack of vision from operators who think there’s no demand?

Hard to believe either—because premium buses run full on Bengaluru and Hyderabad routes, with passengers willing to pay a premium.

Meanwhile, TN’s ""premium"" option is often a decade-old, truck-chassis sleeper. Pretty disappointing for such high-traffic routes.

1grxd4r,chennai,This is a note from your healthcare worker.,"Hello all. 

As a doctor who served in the government till a while ago, I'm very unsettled to come across many acts of violence and hatred to my colleagues in the health system. I'm forced to write this because, not only can I understand how everyone dedicated to this system is feeling about these incidents, but it's also haunting to know that I have a good chance to be the next victim to such ruthless attacks. 

First of all, it's very sickening to know the collective mentality of the public towards our profession, through gruesome incidents like these. When the news of a food delivery agent getting assaulted got around, everyone on the internet was all in support of him, just like how I was. No one really bothered to know how he messed up his work or where did he go wrong. I'm not trying to equate the mistakes done in food delivery to those done in healthcare, but I'm highlighting the hypocrisy of the very same internet public who didn't even consider the impact of the stab attack on the oncologist, which is a criminal and inhumane offence. This is exactly where you as public, have failed every healthcare worker that has helped you all through your life, right from the day you were conceived in your mother's womb till present. Please note, any honest & dedicated healthcare worker does not expect any worship from patients, only a little bit of the kindness they show to you, in return. 

When the founder of Infosys went suggesting of longer working hours for all IT employees, you all know how the internet reacted to it. I'm not establishing the fact that healthcare workers work way more hours than any other white collared professionals, but I'm trying to invoke your feeling towards a person's decreased efficiency and poor outcomes of working for long hours. Unfortunately, the government run health system has always been running like this, where health workers at the point of primary contact with patients, work for 24-36 hours continuously, atleast once or twice in a week, so I hope you can imagine how the quality of our work would be towards the end of such shifts. And not to mention the pathetic environment and resource limited settings we work in. But inspite of all this, we are trying our maximum to do what is best for a patient, till the last straw. Nobody here would have ever made it this long if they had been negligent the whole time, like how the public imagines us to be. Nobody knows the value of one's life better than us, trust me, we've had our hearts crushed every time when a life departs. 

How is it that an airline company is also at fault, along with the pilot, if an aircraft is unable to survive some turbulence or an impending crash? But how is it that the organisation running the hospital is never at fault (in the oncologist's case, the government), but it's always the fault of the doctor in charge when a patient's condition worsens or probably dies despite all treatment, especially in life threatening and terminal illnesses? Even if the doctor or the hospital is at fault, why does no one understand medical boards and courts exist to address such events? 

Please note that most of the healthcare workers dealing with you in government hospitals are at the brink of breaking down, and I hope you understand it's mainly the fault of our very own health system. Most of us do understand your feelings when you or your beloved is sick, but none of you get how we feel about this, but it's okay cuz you're not expected to. But atleast you as public, could be a bit human to us, allow us to do our work and not interfere with your half baked knowledge of medicine and health system, which I know is sourced from biased films and media houses. 

You know that you need to be a bit nice to your waiter serving your food, or else he might spit in it. We as healthcare workers would never do anything equivalent to a waiter spitting in your food, but since we are also overworked humans due to a resource limited overburdened health system, we accidentally might be a bit rude to you or your beloved ones, but trust me, we don't feel pleasant about it either. We are in fact, forced to be rude only in extreme situations where we cannot tolerate you any further. But I'd like to warn you that from now on, any healthcare worker, even in the government, would definitely think ten times before dealing with any patient with complicated illnesses or having complicated attenders, for the sake of our own safety because we know that we would never be compensated or atleast shown some empathy if we face any such attacks. 

Thank you if you read till here. But all we could do is only rant.",100,48,1731680325,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1grxd4r/this_is_a_note_from_your_healthcare_worker/
1k1y1i8,chennai,"Police complaint on tuition, please advise!!!","Hello guys, I live near Vadapalani. Right next to our house is my aunts house who lives in an apartment she is a widow. Her livelihood is running a home tuition for kids. Note that it is not a tuition center and that she takes tuition inside her house. A few months ago one of her neighbor has been harassing her that they are causing a disturbance to the other homeowners (no one else seemed to have complained but that one neighbor). There was an incident that lead to this complaint wherein the neighbor claimed the slippers were placed all over the walk area and that the students are way too noisy and they both went into a conflict after which a complaint was filed and the police came inspected and warned my aunt. Case closed. After this she made sure that the kids always conducted themselves In a disciplined manner.The doors are closed to make sure no noise  and slippers placed neatly not in the way of anyone. She installed a cctv camera as well because the neighbors lover had screamed in the conflict and she was now scared. Recently the neighbor again made a complaint to the eb office that this was a commercial activity upon which the eb came inspected and then confirmed that it was not. Again yesterday the neighbor complained to the police station that there was disturbance again. Today we went to the police station to show the cctv footage that the doors are closed and that we have evidence in our defense. The police station advised us to continue taking tuition in the same manner and said that he would talk to the inspector. I’ve talked to my lawyer friend and he said that they can’t really proceed legally since it is not a tuition center and not a commercial activity. Is there anything anyone would like to advise us at this point? Anybody who has faced something similar to help us out? My aunt is super distressed by all this and she just wants this all to stop but she can’t stop the tuition since she has no other way of supporting herself. 

Update: Hey there! So, there’s been some progress in the situation. The neighbour, who was being stubborn with her first attempt at trying to prove that this is a commercial activity by informing the eb office and failed, decided to approach this differently. She sent a notice to the GCC, claiming that my aunt was conducting business in her flat. A representative from the GCC visited my aunt and informed her that she would now have to pay professional tax. If she does choose to pay, it might be easier to bring legal notices, as it could be proven to be a commercial activity in a flat. This could also cause problems with the EB office. My aunt was feeling quite overwhelmed and lost. My grandmother, who’s over 85 years old, went to speak with the neighbour and try to convince her, but she was adamant. We suggested that my aunt rent out a space right opposite our house and continue her tuition there. Despite losing some money, my aunt agreed to do this. She finally has the freedom to go about her tuition the way she wants, without being confined to batches or timings. She can do as she pleases since this is an own house. The only downside is that she’s losing some money, but she’s finally at peace, which is a sweet relief for her.

This is a 1km stretch of Mario gameplay. Most blocks are shaking and you never know which one would take you down. What is the issue? Poor materials? Or are people doing something wrong? I don't get it. This has never survived without a patchwork for even a month. It keeps happening. 

Some background: This is in velachery 100ft road, the one towards Velachery railway station, Chennai silks, PVR, etc. This is a very common place for walking and running too. Since this is a 100ft road you can't walk or run in the road, vehicles oda speed usually at 60-100 kmph here. 

Where to report this or is that even useful if its gonna break again in a month. Is there a permanent solution to this.",171,22,1739891663,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1isex8m
1k54luh,chennai,"Looking for a reliable, low-noise 2-ton AC for living room (India) – No budget limit, need expert suggestions","I’m looking for suggestions from fellow Reddit users on buying a 2-ton AC for my living room in India.

There’s no budget limit, and the primary usage will be during the summer—around 2-3 hours in the daytime and 6 hours from evening to night.

I’ve seen some Mitsubishi Electric models online. I know the brand is excellent, but I’ve heard (from YouTube reviews) that if any issues arise, the maintenance costs can be high since only imported genuine parts can be used.

At home, I already have 3 non-inverter Panasonic ACs—two 1.5-ton units and one 1-ton unit. They’ve been running for 9 years without a single issue except for yearly general servicing.

I also have a Lloyd 1.5-ton inverter AC, which is 7 years old. It came with a 5-year PCB warranty, and exactly 10 days after the warranty expired, the PCB failed, costing me ₹6000 for repairs. Now, I’ve added a V-Guard stabilizer with it.

Now I’m searching for a 2-ton AC for the living room, which is around 160 to 180 sq. ft. My top priority is low noise from the indoor unit. That’s very important to me.

Please suggest some good 2-ton ACs, including the ideal star rating I should go for, and models that are reliable in terms of maintenance and long-term usage. Would appreciate all the details, including any issues I might face in the long run.

Thanks in advance!

1gbnpfa,chennai,House owner rant,"I'm new to chennai transitioning from wfh to wfo. Me and my wife got this house where everything looked good. The owner doesn't bug us with any other tasks or charge any additional rent or anything as such. But she is too concerned about the people who visit us, she always expects that I should inform her whenever anyone visits my home except my parents or my wife's parents. That felt quite weird. The entire apartment with about 6 houses is owned by her and she is staying on the top floor. Whenever we leave or someone comes in she always notices which feels super weird like I always have a feeling that a couple of eyes is watching me. She directly says that it is for the safety of the residents that she wants to know who leaves and enters the house.
Yesterday we left the house for diwali vacation , we were planning to leave my bike inside the apartment (usually we leave it outside ) and I checked with my owner for the same. She asked me to give her the keys and said her husband would leave it inside . She said post that she will drop the keys inside my house through the window. I genuinely did not want to disturb them and I said that I will do it my self. She came down with me instructed where to leave the bike and everything as they wanted to paint the outside of the house when we leave she wanted the bike to be in a place where it does not affect the activity. Now all of a. Sudden she calls in the morning and started shouting saying because of the bike they cannot paint the house it is blocking this is why I asked for the key and you refused. You should have trust in the owner etc etc. To add on to all this fuss I accidentally locked my house with the stool which they used to paint . I got a good amount of shouting for that too. I agree the later is my mistake but regarding the bike it is really running all day in my mind jeopardising my vacation. 

Not sure if I'm  over reacting , some times she seems too nice but sometimes it is irritating to the core. When I tried to explain my self in the message she started saying 'Neenga engaluku erakam paka venam nanga tha ungaluku erakam pakanum. Nanga epdiyo paint adikirom ungalala ipo en husband theru theruva stool thedi alairaru bike irukra edathla paint adika mudila, neenga nalla diwali kondati vanga. Message anupi tension pannathinga'. Honestly I don't know what to react. This is running in my mind for a while. Any suggestions on how to handle this please 

Edit : Forgot to mention that she doesn't let any of the tenants speak among themselves. She says they might fight among them causing chaos and sometimes she even goes to an extent saying that this might cause some illegal relationships ",124,42,1729836917,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1gbnpfa/house_owner_rant/

1gk0l9l,chennai,Newspaper Intern - No longer an intern,"Hello Chennai!!! What's up? It's your favourite newspaper intern again.. oh I guess I no longer can say that! Doesn't mean I was converted into FTE. Photojournalism is a small department with less demand, so they just didn't have a spot vacant for my ass. This is the case with every newspaper agency.

Having completed this internship is a big deal for me. Long story short, I'm now 26. And for the last 6 years, I've attended interviews for internships at various wedding photography studios (those Mylapore, Alwarpet, Adyar ones. Can't really blame me for having some standards for my work). Their reason for rejection was almost always my disability (yes I am, if you can still remember, I'm Hard of Hearing). They obviously didn't explicitly say this. But we just know that there are always going to be better candidates in whatever place I try in. Why pick me over a candidate with better ""capacity"" right? It just proves the fact that there is no defect with my ""work"", cos that's how I made it to final round of interviews all these years. Work speaks! So yeah, I've got good potential, good talent, etc. Their loss for not have given me an opportunity.

Coming back to this internship, I just loved loved loved doing the work. There have been chatters within the office that I did relatively better than most of their interns they've ever got. When the Oct 15 rains inundated the city, I dove in head first into the field, giving multi-angle coverage of ground work. Something most of their interns would've been hesitant to do. I was aware what I signed up for and did it with all my might. It was a one month internship and I only took 2 days leave due to fever. More than them regretting it, it was me who regretted it more because those 2 days were the days where the newspaper was covering 2 famous celebs for pre-deepavali interviews. Missed chance. :')

They loved my work and I could see that they still wished that I continued working there. Just that they didn't have a spot vacant and I could no longer chug out my savings to continue as an intern. 

Now, I want to appreciate something that was a reason I survived everyday. Food. In the early days, I tried various place trying to find that one place that I can stick to. Nothing worked. I had both hygiene and affordability as a criteria. Tried the cheap thallu vandi lunches which cost ₹50 for a variety rice. Didn't like both the taste and hygiene. Went to Guest, Sangeetha, A2B, etc. didn't meet my everyday budget. Then my uncle had suggested to me ""Doveton Cafe"". It became my saviour. Apparently, it was his saviour in his days too. Limited meals for a amount of ₹95? It was just perfect for me. The meal portion was perfect as well. And hygiene, it worked pretty well for me. I have seen coat suited businessmen (probably reminiscing their early days) to auto annas in their 70s (auto thathas in this case?) eating there in the meals section. And most importantly, I want to appreciate the workers there. They're probably being paid peanuts for the work they do, but man, their resilience, their integrity, it's just something to be celebrated about. Even their security guard who handles parking was a man in his late 60s and I've never seen it slow him down. On the last day I ate there, I just wanted to give him a tight hug for his resilience, for showing the world that you've to wake up everyday and fight it off. I couldn't do that and make it awkward for him, so I just gave him a big tip as much as I could. ₹50.🥲

Basically, what I'm saying is, that place showed me that old Madras charm still exists. In this era of 12LPAs, 24LPAs and I'm buying this car, I'm buying that car, etc. grounded people still do exist and it's them who keeps Chennai running. These luxuries just doesn't matter. At least, that's what it made me believe.

One unique thing that I learnt from working for a newspaper is, even protests has holidays. Those big 4 days of Deepavali holidays, no kandana aarpaattams, no unnaa virathams, nothing. It was really peaceful that weekend. Every other weekends and even on weekdays, it was always some organisation doing protests to seek attention to an issue. Tbh, I found out even protest sites work like mandapam bookings XD. The booking has to be made in the form of permission from the police. Police only has couple designated spots for protests. And even the protesters has to start and finish within the designated time. So that spot can be allotted to another organisation for protests later in the day. I just find this whole protest concept funny. 

Now that the internship is over and there is no vacancy there or anywhere else, it's just me going back to Freelancing a.k.a Unemployment.

1ggau8s,chennai,I am dumb - part 2. ,"[UPDATE TO MY PREVIOUS POST from yesterday titled “I am dumb” - I don’t know how to link that here]. 

After getting back home, still reeling from my antics, I checked for trains to Chennai today and booked the Vande Bharat which leaves from Bangalore at 2:55 PM. YES, I QUADRUPLE CHECKED THE DESTINATION. 

To give some context, I regularly take trains from Bangalore to Chennai and the routine journey from my house to the station is 35-40 minutes. I started looking for Uber / Ola, an hour and 15 minutes prior to the train. Weirdly, wasn’t getting any. 

Decided to just catch a running auto at 2, managed to get one. Just so happened to be raining around then - traffic was intense. 

Kept pleading the auto driver to go fast, and it looked like I’d just about manage to make it in the nick of time. 

While I was super busy looking at Maps and ETA and stressing about reaching, I didn’t realise that the auto driver took a wrong turn just before the station. 

So, guess what? It’s the first time I’ve missed a train in my life (I’m not counting yesterday lol) and I’m on my way back to my house, again. 

Guess this Diwali is just not meant to be for me. I know both these instances were on me, but still. 😂 As they say, “saguname seri illa”. 

If you’ve reached this far, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Happy Diwali again, y’all!

1h80f1m,chennai,No rules for 2 wheelers,"Hello everyone! This is just a rant oh how bad people are driving these days. Especially 2 wheelers. The types of people that I see are:

Wrong route/ lane people:
Two-wheelers who go in the opposite route/ lane as they find even a small gap. What these dumb fucks fail to realise that they are obstructing the people in the opposite side. Once, I was dropping my friend at 7 AM in the main road(the main road of Arumbakkam Megamart to be precise)and while doing so, a 20's woman comes in the opposite lane. She looks at me and shouts, "" Enga neekara, arivu illam?"" My friend in the car replied, ""Nee Vara lane correct ah??"" She could not make eye contact with any of us after that. Imagine breaking the law and having the fucking audacity to pinpoint others. Fucking imbecile


Middle of the road:
We need to study on what goes in their brain. Imagine going in the middle of the fucking road, not allowing anyone else to travel in it. I see wayyy to many cars and bikes do this. When I ask these ""high"" IQ people on why they drive live this, they reply like, ""Venuna nee chinna car vangu"". Dei dumbass, I am driving a Celerio da. If you think that is big, imagine what would their reaction be when a Innova Crysta comes in their way. Or they reply like, ""You also drive in 2 wheelers."" Fair point. But I can't take my 80 year old grandmother in a bike, right? Hence I a car


Going through the gaps of severe traffic:
When people are in a traffic jam situation, most of us will wait until we have space and we move. Whereas we have some fuckers who try to go in that traffic as well. As if they don't reach their destination in the next 10 minutes, they will lose 20 crores. While going in this traffic, these two-wheelers have scratched my car more than once. When I try to confront them, they literally run away. One guy literally smiled and went. As if what he did was a big achievement. Assholes.

Even today, while I was going from Anna Nagar to Mogappair, a woman was going in a hurry and scratched my car. She didn't even look back. I tried chasing her but she ran away. 

You might think that my rants are like that guy in Pichaikaran 1, but these are actually real things that I see almost everyday.

1m6vb4i,chennai,"Budget-Friendly and Durable Main Gate ideas(10x6, Covered) – Chennai Climate","Hi all,

I’m currently building my home at Tambaram and looking for suggestions for a budget-friendly yet durable main gate. I’m torn between stainless steel (SS) and mild steel (MS) options. While SS is more durable and low-maintenance, it’s a bit out of my budget at the moment. MS gates are relatively affordable, but I’d like to explore ways to reduce the overall weight and cost further.

One idea I came across is using HDL board or similar lightweight materials along with MS framing.

My main goals are:

Gate size: 10x6 ft

Privacy: The gate should be fully covered — people from the outside shouldn't be able to see inside

Durability: Should hold up well in the long run

Affordability: Looking for cost-effective materials or design hacks

Climate-suitability: This is for a house in Tambaram, so it should withstand heat, humidity, and occasional heavy rains without rusting or degrading quickly.


Has anyone here used lightweight boards or composite materials with MS framing? Are there any low-cost alternatives that are durable in Chennai’s coastal climate?

Would really appreciate ideas, photos, or even cost breakdowns if anyone has done something similar!

1gqxpa7,chennai,How TN Medical System functions ,"It's high time that the general public knows how the medical system actually is and how a few stakeholders are the real gainers. To give you context, I did my UG from a govt medical college and I'm a third gen doctor so you needn't worry about fact checking these claims. 

1. CM Scheme

This is the biggest problem. Earlier on, every department used to get funds regularly to buy new equipment or upgradation but now, everything is dependent on CM scheme. 

Basically - if you treat patients who have CM scheme card and if their disease fits a certain category of conditions, you will be paid a certain amount. For stroke it is 25,000 so on and so forth. This has led to admission of patients who have the scheme card more than those who don't and this is much worse in surgical departments where in many colleges only patients with scheme cards are posted for surgeries. 

It is an open secret as to who makes money and there are yearly targets for this ;) and the biggest job of a 1st year PG/Intern is to get these claims approved. 

Just imagine you walk in with an operable condition and you're denied/postponed treatment cause of lack of this card. They are trying to force it down everyone's throat to get the card so that everyone can claim to use the card. And more repeatability= more votes. 

2. Lack of resources

This holds true for peripheral colleges. I've personally seen Emergency Departments run out of the most basic necessities.... My father was appalled when he heard what was happening as the same happened when he did his PG in 1986 lol. 

See, the health minister visits MMC and a few Chennai colleges regularly and they're well kept but please go away from Chennai to see for yourself :)

3. PHC's (Primary Health Centres) 

There are so many vacancies in PHC's and district hospitals but they refuse to add more doctors as it increases their payroll. This should be a seperate post in itself.... How they fake the number of doctors and how the supplies are so minimal. There's a PHC wherein we used to see around 200 patients per day but only one intern was there.

And in most govt hospitals and PHC, it is the same 5-10 medications prescribed. If anyone without mbbs also spends just 5 days even they can work in a govt set up. 

4. Lack of cleanliness

Even to the worst of my enemies I won't want them to be admitted in a GH as they're so dirty. This is partly the problem of the patients and attenders who don't keep it clean but the maintenance is given out to some contractors who, varying from place to place, manage it differently. 

By mistake I entered a washeoom thinking it was something else and the stench was something I'd never want to smell again. Just because people don't pay doesn't mean they shouldn't be given clean places to stay. 

5. Working hours of doctors

I will make a detailed post on this but trust me, we are not villains. We aren't here to loot your money. Okay, I can't generalise everything but trust me, most of us are well meaning. 

But, imagine you're at the end of a 36 hour shift and already dead tired- it is impossible to be at your best behaviour and fine movements are fuc*ed. I don't think any other country imposes such inhumane working hours on its doctors. This frustration and stress just keeps piling on and at some moment, the person breaks and shouts at a patient- trust me, even you'd do it... And all hell breaks loose. 

Okay this point is for some other day but I really wish that the general public knows the reality of a govt doctor/PG and the pay and everything. 

Good day. 

P.S. this post was triggered aftee seeing the comments on social media after a senior doctor was stabbed yday in Chennai. I lost a very close person in my life to Hodgkins Lymphoma and I know it hurts but please, violence isn't the solution.

1fvheol,chennai,Why do doctors not call Time of Death? ,"My wife's grandmother recently passed away last Saturday night. While it was something that we were all prepared for, since she had been in bad health for a long time, the one thing that I found really distasteful during this whole situation was the attitude of doctors and so-called reputed hospitals. Let me elaborate. 

After my wife's grandmother was not receptive to any calls, and we could feel that her body had gone cold, I had immediately taken my motorcycle to visit a local medical practitioner, a very small clinic. I told him the situation, and he said 

""Sir, I don't think there's much that I can do, since you're saying her skin is cold, her pupils don't constrict for light, and there's no pulse/heartbeat. It sounds like she's passed on already.""

Me: ""I understand that sir. But I'm not a medical practitioner. I'd ask you to take a look at the patient, and if it really is the case that she's passed on, I think the next action to be done is call Time of Death and write it down on a certificate."" 

Dr: ""I can't do that, sir. I'm a private practitioner. Only govt doctors can call time of death."" 

At this point, I was confused, since I have a younger brother who is also studying his masters in medicine, and I know for a fact that the only thing you need to call time of death is a valid medical license. But I left it at that, since he already said he had a lot of other patients to deal with and couldn't make the house call. 

I called the ambulance (108) immediately, who arrived within 5 minutes of calling (Appreciate the rapid response fellas), the two men who came checked the pulse in various spots, did CPR, checked for pupil response, the usual stuff. After a good ten minutes, they said ""Sir, we cannot detect any signs of life, nor can we resuscitate. We don't think she's made it."" 

Me: ""So what's the next step, sir?"" 

Ambulance Workers: ""Sir, you should call a hospital to bring a doctor here, check the patient and get a Time of Death certificate."" 

Me: ""Thanks. Would Prashanth hospital suffice? They're the biggest hospital nearby."" 

Ambulance Workers: ""Yes, that should be fine."" 

I signed for the ambulance and they went on their way. 

Now, since I live near Prashanth Hospital, Velachery, near Vijayanagar Bus Stop, I took my motorcycle to the hospital and waited for a few minutes until the person I was directed to speak to had dealt with another patient's queries. I finally explained my situation, from finding grandmother lifeless, to calling a private doctor, to calling the ambulance, to being directed to come here. 

The man said ""Sir, Prashanth hospital's Policy is that we cannot declare Time of Death."" 

Me, a little flustered, but okay. ""Okay sir, if that's the case, what should I do next?"" 

Prashanth Hospital: ""Sir, I don't know, but we cannot declare Time of Death"" 

Me: ""I understand that, sir. But I am asking you what I should be doing, This is not an extraordinary case. An old woman passed away in her sleep in her home. This must happen a lot in this city, in this country. All I want to know is what I should do next."" 

He took his phone out and talked to someone, whom he finally revealed as the Nurse Superintendent. After a call of about 5-10 minutes, he came to me and finally said the following. 

""Sir, I will repeat again. Prashanth hospital does not declare Time of Death for any patient, including existing patients in our record. We also do not make house calls. What we can do is the following. We can call an ambulance to your location, pick the patient up, bring them here, and check for signs of life. If the patient has signs of life, then we can do treatment here. If the patient doesn't have signs of life, then we will drop them off at your residence and you can take any steps from your end."" 

Hearing this, I lost it. I raised my voice and said ""So you're telling me that Prashanth hospital doesn't declare anyone to have died at their hospital. Does that mean nobody at Prashanth hospital has ever died? That must make you either the best hospital in the world or the worst hospital in the world."" 

The man didn't really respond to what I said, instead saying ""If you have a complaint, I can give you a complaint sheet and you can fill it out."" 

I got angry and while I didn't yell, I told him ""I don't have time for your nonsense right now."" and left. 

I visited another hospital nearby, wherein the hospital worker there (not educated, just looked like a cleaning lady), went inside to see the doctor and explained my situation to the doctor, who told the lady to say ""The doctors don't make house calls"" 

Since this was late at night, the nearby GH was also closed. My wife, Mother-in-law, and I called a few other hospitals and private doctors, who all said they will not make house calls, or they won't declare Time of Death. 

Finally, one doctor did agree to come and make a house call. But he said he would charge 10,000 Rupees. We couldn't believe the incredulity of the whole situation and cut the call. 

Finally, we called a nearby funeral services, and they brought a freezer box, and I explained to them what happened and they said ""Sir, don't worry. We'll get the Time of Death certificate in the morning. Why have you been running around? Rest for now, please. And let us take care of the rest."" 

The funeral went smoothly on Sunday, and as mentioned by the funeral services people, they brought us a time of death certificate without any hassle. 

Now that you know the whole story, I'd like to ask the following questions. 

1. Why are doctors so hesitant to do a simple process which is done thousands of times every day?  
2. Why did the ambulance workers guide us astray by telling us to go and get the Time of Death Certificate from a hospital, when they could have told us to go and visit funeral services?   
3. If the answer to 2 is ""Maybe they wanted a licensed doctor to verify the death before claiming she's actually dead."", then I have to ask, why are ambulance workers not given an option to call a doctor onto the premises for such a requirement? This should be fairly straightforward.   
4. Why are hospitals refusing to make house calls, especially in cases of patients who are unable to walk/move? Keep in mind, this was not 3 AM at night. We found her dead at 9:30 PM, and by roughly 10 PM, I was at Prashanth hospital's reception.  
5. Why do hospitals like Prashanth Hospitals have a policy citing that they will not declare time of death?  
6. Why did Prashanth Hospitals not say ""Sir, when this happens, you should call funeral services who can declare the time of death for your funeral requirements."", if they couldn't declare time of death or make a house call? 

Why is this system so broken and inept on every single fundamental level? ",135,34,1727987311,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1fvheol/why_do_doctors_not_call_time_of_death/

1)the auto hub at SRMC-Porur to Poonamallee - u can see atleast 8-10 autos there sometimes more especially during peak hours of the city. these auto driver's showcase peak arrogance and are power hungered (especially the ones whose ""been there for so long"") the way the snatch the weaker ones (mostly the new ones)passengers all by only pure threatening..
let me tell u an incident these share-autos only depart if they are fully packed(6-8passengers)and if there are three autos at a time awaiting departure if one has 4 customer...and parallelly if the weaker one has atleast one passenger he is forced to let go off them by pure hate mongering triggers like ''yarra ni ipovanthavanla... and bluffed more'' I saw a auto driver with teary eyes filled with pure aggression telling 'niye vachiko na' and forced me to let me go to the partially packed auto and went off...and even after that he was still waiting for the vehicle to get fully packed and the fellow passengers were waiting for more than 10 mins to depart..if they had walked away they would have reached kaatupaakam by then..it was very triggering considering that it was a hospital spot and maybe u are a relative of a patient who spent the night with them or a hospital staff who worked a 12 hr night shift..all them already being shit tired and then facing a situation like this is deeply triggering and I'm anguished
these power-hungered driver's want all the passengers to themselves and not let anyother take away from them...

2)also seen a similar situation like these in Guindy industrial estate bus stand-koturpuram:
the white share auto drivers are pathetic and mostly filled with pure greed. they will probably drop u off till anna university and say ""traffic romba Iruku ma..vandi povathu"" and they still want 30 rs for it...it was usually 20 rs till kotupuram itself..i travelled that route from 2023...now they demand 30 considering the traffic especially during peak hours..and even there only passengers are allowed to sit on the second vehicle only when the first one is filled and I have experienced it personally when I was running late for an exam and he said me to go in the first auto because it's almost packed..but it was the one that goes till anna university..my destination is Madras University,koturpuram..i denied...i don't wanna give 30 till anna university and take another auto or bus to koturpuram...

all my life traveling in buses with sweltering heat and heavy rush has made me hate buses and now autos too...

anyone with similar experiences?",30,14,1749189247,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1l4l1ru/power_hungeredgreedy_share_autos/

I was part of both India defence and Pakistan subreddits during the pahalgam attack. 

It's full of IT cells writing up bullshit posts to the point nobody knows truth or validate it. 

News in India - we killed Terrorists

News in Pakistan - India killed commoners 

And also China sells military equipments to Pakistan. 

In a nut shell. 

All the news we consume are cooked for narrative cooked by each nations ruling party, but not truth, so to be politically aware of it. Don't take sides, vet every news you hear, don't fall for your friend who talks politics without data. 

But hey wait, our union government releases bogus data lol. They publicly released lowest inflation in 6 years and proceeds to raise toll price lol. 

Be considerate in 2026 elections. Spend time to find truth rather than falling for insta reels and narratives. 

I am not a pro, but shoot questions if you have any, I will try to answer them. 

This is my way of vetting news

I watch puthiya thalaimurai - most nuetral - they are still a media channel, they try to subtly show truth but wont be outright about it. 

I watch Vikatan's ""Imperfect show"" everyday at 7pm on their youtube channel - by far the best source of news. 

Polimer - they are kind of a mockery, they will play for all the parties won't take sides sometimes run with what people want to hear. But even they took side when there was this murugar temple issue. Lol

I live in North Bihar. This water shortage isn’t just a headline .... it’s our daily life now.

The handpump in my neighbor’s yard.. Completely dry. People from my village walk farther each week just to find working pumps. My own family has started storing every drop like it’s gold. And honestly, it feels like no one outside this region really knows what we’re going through.

The rains this year were late. And even when they came, they were scattered and weird..one day flood-like rains, then nothing for weeks. The ground is giving up. Groundwater has gone so deep that even the older pumps are failing.

The Bihar govt sanctioned 528 new handpumps and yes, it’s something. But it still feels like a band-aid on a much deeper wound. Because what happens next summer? What happens if rains fail again?

I just want to say this to anyone reading this from a city or another state:
Please don’t take your water for granted.
That long shower? That running tap while brushing? That tank overflow you ignore?
It’s a privilege.
A privilege that some of us don’t have anymore.

Respect water. Save it. Talk about it. Teach your kids. Harvest rain. Fix your leaking taps. Do the boring stuff  because trust me, you don’t want to know what it feels like to not have clean water in your own home.

Currently, GPUs are considered essential to run large AI models because of their capability for parallel processing. Meanwhile, CPUs - found in regular devices - are considered inefficient for such purposes since they are suited for more sequential tasks. 

Ziroh Labs have developed a system in partnership with IIT Madras which runs these large AI models using CPUs. The system has been tested by Intel and AMD and has successfully run models including DeepSeek, Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen. A while back Google’s own tests demonstrated that CPUs can achieve competent latencies for large language models, though typically requiring larger batch sizes to match GPU efficiency. 

This is significant since specialised hardware / GPU infrastructure is quite expensive and mostly accessible to large corporations. The restrictions on export / sale of GPUs by the USA has exacerbated this problem. Ziroh’s stuff could make AI compute power far more accessible by eliminating the need for such hardware.

1gbppwm,india,From an Indian to an Indian,"Sometimes I (live in Krakow) am ashamed to be seen an Indian. The title says that, I want to ask as an Indian who also lives abroad to the indians who live abroad too, why can’t you guys understand that your behaviour is seen by everyone.

Yesterday I came from a flight from Munich to Delhi (now it’s not about north or south, i will post it Delhi subReddit too since the flight was for Delhi) my flight was delayed by 8 hours but i swear I didn’t even get close to being pissed but it changed I started seeing the people who will board the flight, flight experience is on another level.

I will say that in points so it is easy to read.

1.) All I was hearing loud Indians shouting their throats out while the other side of the airport was fine.

2.) People were blasting their instagram reels on full volume.

3.) Breaking queues while others waited for hours just to be behind a guy who doesn’t have basic human etiquettes.

4.) I never believed the stereotypes about stinking Indians because I never crossed them, but it changed. Is it too hard to carry a deodorant?

When i when boarded the flight

5.) Immediately there was a panic because people started sitting on seats which weren’t theirs’ because they wanna sit with their fam…meanwhile others are getting pissed and foight attendant had to come and fix.

6.) One guy asked for chocolates 7-8 times and even gave his meal twice, yes she didn’t say no because she cant but i could see that on her face. What’s the obsession with free stuff? All i am saying is that doesn’t leave a good impression 

7.) Women besides me, kept all the hand-rest space for herself and was so ignorant when i tried to take a bit of space by again forcing her elbows in. And also i was asked to change my seat (i didn’t)

8.) She took her shoes and the stench was so horrible that me and the guy(from Slovakia) beside me woke up and couldn’t complain because it’s just rude. I went to attendant and asked for a different seat but the flight was full and she said “yes we have problem with smell in this flight” gave me a balm to rub on my nostrils so that i dont smell. Thats what they use.

9.) While picking up the luggage a member of helping staff was helping a disabled lady and she was trying to see her luggage but people are sooooo ignorant and started blocking her because they want to go first.

Now I see why my friend takes business class, i will do the same.

All I am trying to say in this post is, if you are an individual who behaves like that, please understand everyone notices it, people are just too nice to point it out. You all are representing India so please behave like a human being.

Update: thanks everyone for sharing the same experiences. I was expecting a lot of hate and insecure patriots saying bad things to me. I am not hating on my country I swear I would be really proud to say that I am an Indian but things like these make me sad.

1jlwg2z,india,"I took an education loan of ₹40L to study in the US — now I’m back in India, drowning in debt, and don’t know what to do","Hi Reddit,

I never thought I’d be in a position where I’d have to write something like this, but I’m out of options and just hoping someone out there can guide me or help.

I’m from India, I took an education loan of ₹40,00,000 from HDFC Credila to pursue my Master’s degree in the U.S. My father ran a small business and, along with my family, they put in a lot they had — emotionally and financially — to help me chase the dream of a better future.

I completed my degree, but due to the economic recession, visa limitations, and lack of internship opportunities for Indian students, I never got a job in the U.S. I applied relentlessly for a year, but couldn’t even earn enough to cover my own living expenses. My family sent me money every month — draining their last savings.

Eventually, my father’s business was making losses and he fell ill. They couldn’t support me anymore, and I had to come back to India, heartbroken, jobless, and with a huge loan on my head. (Update: He’s better now and healthy)

⸻

After months of searching, I finally landed a job here in India that pays me ₹75,000/month — but my EMI is ₹66,000/month. That leaves me with just ₹9,000 as personal savings, now the business is running and it can support the family, and handle everything else. I’m trying to pick up extra freelance or part-time work, but between my day job and my father’s aging, I’m emotionally and physically drained.

I feel like my whole life will go into just surviving this crisis. We were a modest middle-class family.

⸻

I don’t know who to turn to anymore. I’m trying to contact the bank for restructuring, applied for side gigs — but nothing has worked so far. That’s why I’m here: asking Reddit for advice, guidance, or if anyone knows how to navigate the next steps further.

If you are / know any hiring manager, Recruiter who can get me an interview at a good company that would be super helpful, feel free to DM me.

I feel confident on my skills that I can crack the interview if given the opportunity. 

I did my MSc in Management Information Systems, Undergrad is in IT. I have a couple of years of work experience doing Tech Product Management, Project Management, AI consulting, Marketing and Sales.

Let me know if you have opportunities in these domains. 

If you’ve been through something similar or know someone who can help — even just to talk — I’d be immensely grateful.

Thank you for reading this far. Just being heard means a lot.

1kyaxgq,india,"Got Cancer, AGAIN. I'm in tears.","Hi everyone, I’ll keep it short and straight.

I was diagnosed with B-ALL (a type of blood cancer) back in 2019, when I was just 13 years old. Thankfully, I was cured back then, but the cost wiped out all our savings.

Now, at 18, I’ve relapsed.

I’m currently undergoing treatment at CNCI Kolkata (2nd campus). The bills have already crossed ₹7 lakhs, and I still have one more cycle of chemo left. After that, I’ll need a bone marrow transplant, which is the most crucial and expensive part.

We’re trying to get a government bed for the transplant, but there’s a high chance we won’t get one due to limited availability. If we have to go the private route, the cost could be ₹20 lakhs or more. Else 2-4 Lakhs. we genuinely don’t even have a clear estimate yet. Even hearing that amount sends shivers down my spine. Like I'd better like to be dead than put my parents under that kinda debt coz yeah. No way they have that kinda money.

My father runs a small grocery shop. After battling cancer once already, raising this kind of money again is just beyond what my family can afford.

To make things even more complicated, the transplant match is only a half-match with my brother. That lowers my chances and increases the risk, but it’s our only option.

I’ve been in the hospital for over 40 days now, still am, mentally and physically drained. Last Chemo being delayed because of high SGPT in my liver. Inotuzumab - each chemo is 2.5L 3rd one being free. So 5L + 2L other charges. I'm admitted on cash. Next cycle will be under swastasathi scheme. 

I don’t usually do this, but we’re out of options. If you can, please consider contributing even a small amount to help me fight this again.

1l6wkue,india,"Worked part-time at Blinkit — 10-minute delivery sounds cool, but the reality for workers is brutal","I worked at Blinkit as a part-time picker and packer while studying, and the experience really opened my eyes.

We all love the idea of getting groceries or snacks delivered in 10 minutes, but most people have no idea what actually goes on behind that “ultrafast” service. The pressure on workers is next-level — and honestly, kind of scary.

The warehouses (called dark stores) are super small, packed with racks and items, and we’re expected to *run* non-stop while picking orders. Like actually *run*, not walk fast. You're dodging other pickers, turning sharp corners, and racing against a timer.

I’ve had a few accidents. Once I collided with another guy and broke my phone. These kinds of things happen almost daily because it’s all rush and no safety.

We had to follow a timer called PPI (Per Picking Item). If it takes even a few extra seconds to find an item (maybe it’s misplaced or out of stock), the manager tells you to log out and go home. The pressure from higher-ups is crazy, and managers just pass it on to the workers.

---

# It’s even harder for full-time staff:

* They unload **2–3 big trucks daily**, manually.
* They often work **longer hours than scheduled**, without proper overtime.
* They have to stock cold rooms too, which is physically tough.
* When part-timers aren't there, **all the workload falls on them** — picking, packing, restocking, everything.

These guys are constantly on their feet and barely get proper breaks. And if anything goes wrong, they get blamed.

---

#What people don’t realise about 10-minute delivery:

*It’s not safe.Workers run through tight spaces all day. Accidents are common.
*It messes with your head. There’s nonstop pressure, no time to breathe.
*Zero tolerance for delays. One small mistake, and you’re told to leave.
*The pay isn’t worth it. The risk, stress, and treatment don’t match what you earn.


 My honest take:

All this effort and stress… just so someone can get a Coke and Maggi in 10 minutes?

Not saying convenience is bad. But this system isn’t built on efficiency — it’s built on pushing workers to their limits. If deliveries took 15 or 20 minutes instead, would that really be so bad?

Feels like we're chasing speed without thinking about the people actually doing the work.


TL;DR:Worked at Blinkit part-time. Behind the “10-minute” delivery hype is a lot of pressure, unsafe work conditions, and poor treatment. Full-time staff have it even worse. Maybe it’s time we care more about worker wellbeing than ultra-fast convenience.

1lb42da,india,Why Are India’s Top Aviation Bodies Still Run by Non-Experts?,"No wonder the systems do not move forward—India’s main aviation organizations tend to be dominated by generalist bureaucrats, not technical specialists. Case in point: the DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation), presently presided over by the IAS (1996 batch, Madhya Pradesh cadre) official Faiz Ahmed Kidwai. He assumed office on January 7, 2025, and possesses a History degree from Aligarh Muslim University. His experience includes several administrative positions, such as that of Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Principal Secretary in Madhya Pradesh—none of them having anything to do with aviation or flight operation.

Likewise, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is headed by Vipin Kumar, the IAS (1996 batch, Bihar cadre), who joined on October 28, 2024. While he is an alumnus of the discipline of Electronics & Communication Engineering, his administrative experience has mostly been in general administration—serving as an Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Education and working in several bureaucratic roles in Bihar.

appointing bureaucrats with little or no domain experience to lead technologically advanced institutions such as the DGCA and AAI weakens the possibilities of innovation, improvement of safety, and efficient operation. Administrative acumen is crucial, but in such consequential areas as aviation, extensive technical know-how cannot be an afterthought—it’s fundamental to good governance and systemic enhancement.",231,37,1749890847,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lb42da/why_are_indias_top_aviation_bodies_still_run_by/

1hywrxi,india,"Please help. My family is desperate, and we’re running out of options","**PS: This is going to be a bit long. Also kindly ignore the username in the comments.**

We are a lower-middle-class family based in MP. My mom is/was a high school teacher, and my dad doesn't do anything. Therefore, my mom has always borne all the family's finances with her low-paying job. But she always believed in working her way up and constantly applied for government teaching jobs. She has always had problems with her hearing and even got a hearing disability certificate from the local city government hospital.

After preparing for exams day and night, while also working a full-time job and handling all the household chores, she finally cleared the *Varg 1 Exam* through a disability quota and with good grades. We were very happy for her.

However, this happiness didn’t last long. Someone filed a petition in court to stop the recruitment process, and everything came to a standstill. During this time, my mom made a huge mistake: she resigned from her only job because she believed she would get the new job soon. Finally, after half a year, the recruiting agency received the green light to continue, and things started moving again. The recruitment list came, and my mom was finally appointed to a school.

But there was a catch. Candidates applying through the hearing disability quota were now required to submit a *BERA test* report, as ordered by the court some years ago (this requirement wasn’t mentioned anywhere earlier). The court’s order said that the city’s medical administration should arrange a medical camp within a week for the candidates, but even after months, they didn’t bother to do anything. Instead, they advised us to get the test done ourselves from any government medical facility equipped to perform a BERA test.

The state of Madhya Pradesh has various districts with facilities for this test, but to our surprise, every single public hospital and medical college denied performing the test. They either refused outright or claimed the BERA machine wasn’t working. My parents traveled from city to city, but had no success. Only AIIMS in Bhopal was willing to conduct the test, but the staff there were rude, and they kept postponing the test for months.

Eventually, we learned that the medical college in Jabalpur was conducting BERA tests. Even there, we faced many challenges, but we finally got the test done. We thought the hard part was over and that we just needed to submit the report. But we were wrong.

We submitted the report to our city’s government medical team as part of the final process, but months later, they still haven’t moved forward. The report is just lying there. We visit their office every day, but nothing ever happens. They keep saying, “We’ll process it tomorrow” or “soon,” but it’s all empty promises. At one point, we thought they were waiting for bribes, so we even tried that (I know this is wrong, but please try to put yourself in our shoes. It’s like a drowning man trying to save himself in any way he can). Yet, even that didn’t work.

Recently, we heard from an insider that they are drafting a letter to higher authorities to order us to redo the test at AIIMS. This makes no sense-nobody else in the entire state was referred to AIIMS, and AIIMS keeps delaying the tests indefinitely. We’re also completely out of money to travel and stay in Bhopal again. Now, we learned that they recently approved another candidate’s record who got their test done at a neighboring city hospital. If their case was approved, why not ours? Why are they putting us through this nightmare?

I've not even mentioned 10% of the hell we are going through since the last few months. I am tired of seeing my parents wake up till 3AM in the morning worrying about the future of our family and I am tired of seeing my mother sobbing every few days since the past few months. I don't know where to go. I don't understand how these things were and whom we are supposed to complain. We don't even have any money to hire a lawyer. 

If someone has knowledge of how these things work then I beg you show us some light. We are desperate and on the verge of poverty. 

Finally, if you spend your time reading this whole thing, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for hearing me. Thank you, dear stranger. 

**TLDR; The local government medical team is not passing a medical report which is needed in order for my mom to get a govt job. We are in poor financial conditions and this delay is bringing us to poverty slowly.**",235,48,1736604973,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hywrxi/please_help_my_family_is_desperate_and_were/
1jwl1zu,india,This country is completely fucked,"Varanasi gang rape- no words left to say. Whether it's work, spirituality, education or anything, it is incomplete without a rape case. 

language wars- women brutally beaten for showing civic sense? Nope can't have civic sense in this nation. She should have just pushed the man to get in.

Pawan Kalyan- The youth is fucked by both it's politicians and it's own parents. Imagine if the kid had reached the coaching centre and would have sat the exam but failed. Imagine the fit the mother would have had. Jee should have been a dream the kids should have cried for but rather it became a bondage the mothers cried on. 

Gender biased laws- Nope wrong. Criminal biased laws. No victim man or woman receives justice.  Also only 50 million cases pending

National pride- Fuck no not unless you want to end up like abhishek swarnkar over ethically handling disputes by warning someone about contacting the authorities. 

Education=money for coaching centres, with latest addition being cuet so immediately after kids are out of schools it is only exams. And also sit competitive exams for a uni which is not even globally recognised

Work- life balance? whatttttt? we don't even give our students any balance it is always exams and homework and as soon as they turn 15 well anything less than 12hrs of study in a day is a criminal offence

population crisis? Nah let's bring in more people, let's pump up illegal migration

ohh government policies? don't get me started. Normally they don't give a fuck about them because they'd rather just focus on comedians but for the rare occasion they do,we have some really hardcore popcorn policies and investment entrances policies coming out into play.

1fjydjk,india,My Honest Experience at EY GDS,"Everyone is talking about the recent case happened at EY. It's so sad to hear this. And since then, I cannot stop thinking about my experience at EY. I never talked about it with anyone, and that is the reason I joined reddit to talk about my experience and seek comfort maybe.

My experience at EY GDS:

1. Manager threatened me that she would destroy my career. 
I asked for an internal transfer and she told me if I don't work well before the transfer happens, she has the power to destroy my career since the new team will be taking my feedback from her.

I put my resignation even before the outcome of the internal transfer was finalized, as the workplace had become unbearable with non stop long working hours and toxic work environment.

So when i put my resignation, nobody asked a question regarding why I resigned.
Then I myself asked to schedule a meeting with a person up in the hierarchy where he asked me if there were any isssues I faced during my tenure. I lied because my manager was also present in the meeting.
Then after the meeting, my manager took me in the corner and again threatened me indirectly by giving hints like I should be mindful of whatever I tell to the senior person since she (my manager) will be providing me the final feedback, and this feedback would be considered if I ever wish to join back. So again I kept quiet. 


2. A senior forced me to call a colleague who was covid positive, therefore he was on a one month leave. Senior forced me to call him and ask him to work.


3. Manager went out of office in the second half on 14th February (Valentine's Day) and I worked for the entire night due to urgent deliverables. When I requested her next morning to allow me a one hour break since I hadn't slept the entire night, she made sarcastic comment as to why I need a break, do I need to go and meet my boyfriend? And then she bashed me over the call for not completing the work and asking for a short break.



4. I asked a doubt while making the workpaper, and the project's manager passed comments about how big4s end up recruiting bcom graduates who don't even know how to work and was very rude to me.


5. On another project, I asked a doubt and my manager said things like - If I had met you in the office, I would have grabbed your ear and straightened you out and taught you a lesson. (This was said in Hindi language which was very rude, however, I didn't write the exact words since as per the guidelines I'm supposed to post in English language)



6. A senior sent review comments around 7.30 pm which is after our official shift hours and next morning, when I didn't correct the review notes, she escalated the matter to my manager at 7.57 AM. My official shift hours start from 8 AM.


7. I believe this is very common but would still like to mention it. Worked for around 14-15 hours minimum during the busy season and often these hours would get extended with no overtime paid. Also, once the busy season of my team used to get over, they would put us in the busy season of other teams.


8. Made to work on many weekends with no comp off.


9. Made to work on 9-10 different clients in one particular week while my own manager didn't take more than 7-8 clients in a week. (This didn't happen frequently but yes it did happen one week during my notice period).


10. When we made an error, and the onshore team escalated the matter, I believe the entire team should work on it and ammend the changes required. However, nobody used to talk about the work. The entire first half was spent in strategizing how to get out of this escalation. And eventually, my managers put the entire blame on me and on the onshore team and the manager escaped the situation.


11. When I asked for an internal transfer - which is a policy highly promoted by the company, my manager shouted at me and asked me to resign. When I told her that she cannot ask me to resign and I need to talk to the HR, she was again very rude to me and kept shouting on the call.


12. I was supposed to leave for my brother's wedding at 2PM on a Saturday, and I was working till 1PM. Then I started packing my bags and went out of town for the wedding, I was super scared because I knew when I would come back, there would be messages either from my manager (who was also my counsellor) shouting at me or someone else.
And the same thing happened, I came back, switched on my laptop, and my outlook was filled with emails regarding work, and my counsellor also emailed me that I shouldn't take any leaves whether planned or unplanned.


13. I worked till 2.30 AM one night and completed the workpaper. Then my senior had the audacity to say - okay please start working on the next workpaper now. I finally refused and told her that I was going to sleep.


14. While I was on my notice period, my counsellor (manager) initially asked me not to take any leaves whether planned or unplanned. When I refused saying that we can take planned leaves and I would like to talk to the senior manager, that is when they got scared and started talking to me politely and said let us talk to the HR.
HR told them that it would be harsh if they ask me to not take my planned leaves. So that is when they started saying that if you take planned leaves, we will extend the notice period etc. I politely told them that they may extend the notice period if this is as per the policies, but I will be taking my planned leaves.


15. When I put down my papers, I informed my manager and she said - ""Okay (name), thanks for confirmation.""
That's it. No questions asked.


16. When I took a stand for my junior regarding how he had been working late nights and we cannot allocate him more work and instead we should allocate the work to someone else, my manager assumed that I might be friends with the junior and started giving me a lecture on how I should learn to differentiate between my personal and professional life.
These people couldn't change the culture. When I tried doing so, I was given a lecture. 


Also, one day my manager was teaching me how I need to learn how to handle situations. For example, once we faced an issue, and she taught me how I should put the accountability on someone else, and should escape the situation.

I never wanted to leave EY. But after I requested for an internal transfer, my counsellor (manager) made it unbearable for me to stay.
Many instances happened which just forced me to resign.

Also, during my tenure at EY, ask my family regarding the number of times I have visited different doctors. You will be shocked to hear about it. I suffered from multiple health issues. Fortunately, I have been able to recover from most of the issues. However, my Migraine is still not cured. I developed migraine because of excessive stress, sleeping for very minimal hours, and work anxiety.

WHO IS RESPONSIBLE when I get migraine attacks now?


Please anyone who is reading this, please don't join EY. Do yourself a favour and run.
These are few of the instances that used to happen at work. My experience was horrible and no matter how much package they offer, I would never ever recommend anyone to join that place. It's full of shit people.

1fum11i,india,his experience has shattered my faith in our country.,"A few days ago, I was debating with my father about how much progress India has made in reducing corruption. I confidently asserted that the problem is getting better, but my dad dismissed my views, saying I didn’t know anything. I laughed it off, thinking he was stuck in his old ways. However, today I faced a harsh reality check. 

My two-wheeler's registration was about to expire, and I was pleased to find that the government has set up an online system for renewal. All I needed to do was visit the RTO on the assigned date for a vehicle inspection. Simple enough, right? Unfortunately, things did not go as smoothly as I had hoped. 

When I logged onto the website to book my appointment, I discovered that the mobile number linked to my vehicle registration wasn't mine; it belonged to a broker. When I contacted him , he explained that he had registered it under his number to assist me in future dealings. When I insisted on changing it to my own number, he demanded ₹4,000. Furious, I threatened to file a police complaint, but he just laughed and blocked my number.

I didn't want to waste time with an FIR since my registration deadline was approaching and daily fines would accumulate if it wasn’t renewed. Armed with all necessary documents, I went to the RTO hoping to resolve the issue. The officer there outright refused to sign anything and kept saying no. After pleading with him, he sent me running from one office to another, giving me nonsensical reasons for my predicament and wasting my entire day.

Exhausted and frustrated, I stepped outside when a random person(another broker) approached me and asked what had happened. After I explained my situation, he offered to help for ₹2,000. At that moment, too tired to argue further, I agreed on the condition that he would change my number first before I paid him. He complied and completed all the necessary procedures within fifteen minutes. Stunned by how quickly it was done compared to my earlier experience, I asked him why I had been rejected initially. He scoffed and said, ""Sir, upar ki kamai."" Panicking, I asked if he had bribed someone; I didn’t want any legal troubles later on due to corruption. 

He laughed again and said that without such payments, officers wouldn’t even open their pen's cap. He explained that this was a common occurrence in Indian government offices—rampant corruption from marriage registrations to property inspections. He mentioned that property officers often leave work with bags full of money every day. 

Later, he informed me that since my vehicle registration had expired, I would incur daily fines unless renewed immediately. He requested an additional ₹3,000 for that service. Defeated and desperate, I paid him the money while he offered me some tea. During our conversation, he reiterated that such scenarios are normal in Indian bureaucracy. 

Within 15 minutes after his sidekick left with all the paperwork, he assured me that my registration would be renewed in 1-2 days. When I returned home and shared this experience with my father, he laughed again and said, “Where is your progressive and modern India now?” This incident left me feeling disillusioned and devoid of respect for my country.

No matter which political party is in power BJP or Congress—the common man continues to face exploitation.

I don’t usually post like this, but I’m at a point where I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’m 26(M) . I finished my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering (2020) and recently completed my MBA in Business Analytics & Marketing (2024).

For the past 8 months I’ve been desperately searching for a job – applying to hundreds of roles, networking on LinkedIn, attending interviews – but nothing has worked out. I even took up a short stint as a Sales Engineer after my MBA just to stay productive, but the role ended in December. Reason being a failed management who didn't know what to do with me, just constant traveling 10hrs a day with no sleep and no day off. It  snapped when  they didn't give me leave for an emergency i had , constant taunting just because i hold an MBA degree, micro monitoring and much more . So i left the firm. Since then, I have been applying to several jobs via various job portals. But have only received rejections.

I’ve always been eager to learn and I’ve built skills in:

Data Analytics – Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Excel, Tableau

Business Intelligence – Predictive modeling, statistical analysis, machine learning basics

Tools – Microsoft Vision.Google Analytics

Other – Generative AI, Stakeholder Management.

I have certifications from IBM, Coursera, Udemy, and have worked on projects like consumer behavior analysis and even engineering design prototypes.

But now I’m running out of savings, confidence, and honestly, mental strength. Every day feels heavier, and some days I wonder if there’s any point in continuing. I’ve been battling thoughts I’m scared to share even with my family.

If anyone reading this can refer me, guide me, or even just point me to the right opportunity (analytics, business analysis, marketing, sales, or even entry-level roles where I can prove myself), you might just be saving more than my career.

The goal isn’t a game for fun it’s more like an interactive simulator where you manage the budget, pass policies, tweak tax rates and deal with real-world events like protests, inflation, or unemployment.

Features we can add:

* Allocate real budget in sectors like education, defense, health.
* Pass policies like free healthcare, farm loan waivers, tax cuts etc.
* Use real data for GDP, INR value, unemployment rate etc.
* Try to balance development, public satisfaction, and re-election.

1lx3wni,india,Recent dowry deaths- My own story of dowry to all the young lovely women out there.,"Happened 1 year ago,

For context: I was 28/F working as a Doctor in London earned 1 Crore per annum, pre tax with my locums and regular salary. Still owe the gov of uk 10 grand in taxes, which i have set up a payment plan with.

So one day, some random unknown distant relative from the same area as the recent Dowry death, UNinvited, came to visit my parent's office in AnnaNagar, Chennai.

They themselves asked to have tea, which my mom ordered. They announced to my mom and dad that they have a most wonderful boy for me marry within the relatives. They mentioned that this wonderful boy finished his UG 4 years ago and is at home preparing for ias. Honestly good for him, but no one in my family asked. They kept noting to my parents, that my parents have a girl, not a boy, and this boy family has their own big house and earn rental money monthly. The boy apparently has somehow seen me on instagram, which btw has only 12 posts, and somehow thought I am a great fit for him.

Then they asked my mom what will my dad give as dowry.? So my mom just asked what.? He said yes, 'When u keep a girl, you have to keep gold only right, you cant just keep flowers.?' Mom was shocked, dad was fighting urge to slap him just for his depiction of women, mom held dad's hands. Then this relative went on to say that I must quit job and come live with the boy in this small town. Also my dad 'must' take care of marriage expenses which should be like a 'festival' and buy some nice suv car.

You would imagine this is the end, but no. He noted that I dont have to be a stay-at-home housewife, as they are very generous and I can finish my morning house chores early and open a small tent outside the house and run it as a clinic and earn money, and support it to the boy's family, whilst he is 'studying' for his ias. Safe to say, the not-so-hot tea he was drinking, was thrown in his face. They cursed me and my parents. My mom answered to this man, that I rather be single and happy than be with such people.

Following this, we suffered backlash from many of my relatives, stating this relative is only asking what is normal in the world. My parents handled it with grace, and any relatives attempting discussion on this incident/dowry were avoided.

It all ended well, because i was in love and now I am in line to get married to my love of my life ..!💍♥️

Ps: Relatives still are vile and toxic about my wedding. I find it appalling that they would rather I marry this guy from the story than the love of my life (also a doctor in uk)

Thankfully I got lucky with my mom and dad, but even if not, I would have just not consented to dowry weddings. The only reason I could do that, was because I am earning my own money and I was educationally and financially independent to say no to everyone. This is my story.",1644,135,1752231597,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lx3wni/recent_dowry_deaths_my_own_story_of_dowry_to_all/

1lpnw7v,india,From 'Condom joke' to 'Kya maal hai' my daily gym ride is getting weird,"So today I went to the gym as usual. There’s this uncle or maybe I should say bhaiya, he's 35+ whom I’ve known for about 2 months. He always talks to everyone girls, boys but especially stares at girls a lot.

I was doing leg curls and using foam support, but it slipped out. He was standing nearby and suddenly whispered in my ear, ""Dekho condom nikal gaya."" 😅 I was so confused I was like, ""Kaun gym mein condom pehen ke aata hai?"" I didn’t really understand, so I just said, ""Kya?""

He talks to women and girls daily, and today I saw him asking a married woman for her number. For context he’s also married. He once told me he wakes up at 4 AM for azaan, drops his little daughter to school, and then comes to the gym.

After our workout, for the past two days he’s been dropping me home on his scooty even though his house is on the opposite side. So he drops me first and then returns.

But today, as we were leaving the gym, he saw a guy with a woman and said to me, ""Dekho kya maal hai."" 😅 I honestly don’t know how that’s appropriate to say to an 18-year-old male like me. It felt weird.

Now I’m not sure what to do. Should I continue talking to this uncle? I know he seems a bit creepy, but he behaves nicely with me and drops me home after the gym.

1mslfau,india,Why can’t food choices just be respected?,"So there’s this girl I (at least) considered my friend. She’s vegetarian, and had this habit of always poking me about my food choices. For example, if something bad happened to me, she would say, “It’s because you eat chicken.”

I always took it lightly and never replied back… until yesterday.

I caught a high fever (for context: I got drenched while trying to help a boy whose scooty got stuck in a pothole). When I mentioned this to her, she once again said, “That’s because you eat chicken.” This time it really triggered me and we ended up in an argument.

First it was vegetarian vs non-vegetarian. I brought up the life of cows in Indian dairies, to which she replied that she feeds two chapatis to a cow every day and doesn’t care about the rest. Basically being deliberately naive or just ignorant.

Then, very “smartly,” she shifted the topic to religion—which I didn’t want to argue about because it’s a sensitive topic and I personally follow a humanist ideology. But in the flow, I did slightly challenge the andhbhakti and religious extremism going around.

That was it. She jumped straight to declaring me “anti-national,” and then, out of nowhere, labeled me “pro-Palestine Islamist.” Mind you, I’ve never said a single word on Palestine or religion in that way. It was all her own assumption.

So yeah, apparently now I’m an anti-national Islamist—just because I don’t follow her worldview.Sorry  I know its a bit long one *) but had to rant a bit . Thank you for your time and your opinions are welcomed.

He came home after 10:30 and didn't talk about it. He is not drunk as well and asked wheather i had dinner. I said no and he said I should eat before 9 and it bad for my health. I don't know what happened because he acts like nothing happened I asked him. You don't care whatever happened to your daughter. You don't care about me . He softly said what if he lies and it will stain my life. I said I don't care . He sat there for a few minutes and went to talk to my neighbour. This neighbor uncle is an auto driver and has a daughter as well. He came to me and asked whether this person touched me. I said yes and he held my hand and almost dragged me to that shopkeeper house. I wanted to run back home but he did not leave my hand. His wife came as well and he started banging their door shouting and calling their neighbours. Most of them are asleep but woke up and this shopkeeper s dad come out and neighbour uncle asked what kind of a son did he give birth to and that uncle asked what happened. He shouted bring your son outside he will tell and his mother called him and he came out . Neighbour uncle started slapping him . His mother and sister were shouting and telling they will call the police. Neighbour uncle said yes do it they will take this person who harassed a minor girl . His father asked what happened and this uncle told him everything and his father started beating him as well and everyone is telling my father to call the police but that shopkeeper uncle pleaded to not to and he will bear the cost and his accept his sons mistake 

My father said I won't take money to let someone touch my daughter and that uncle apologized. We returned home after more shouting.

All thanks to my neighbour uncle. His wife told me to never go ask anyone for work and said she will teach me tailoring after school everyday. Yes she is a tailor. Although everyone was looking at me and talking about me i didn't feel fear because of the neighbour uncle.

1kir2bg,india,From the fall of Islamabad to an attack on Karachi: 5 fake stories that Indian TV news ran with,"1. ‘Army chief Asif Munir arrested’

Early in the morning on May 9, Zee News published a story claiming that “reports” had emerged that Pakistani army chief Asif Munir had been “taken into custody by Pakistani authorities” because he had been working on “his personal agenda”.

Not only that, several channels of the network claimed that “General Sahir Shamshad Mirza was being considered as Munir’s possible replacement”.

2. ‘Karachi port destroyed’

Around 11 pm on Thursday, several Hindi, English and regional news channels began reporting that the Indian navy had opened another front against Pakistan. Some said that the Navy had “attacked and destroyed” the Karachi port. All of these claims were made either without attribution or by citing “sources”.

For example, ABP Ananda passed off a 37-second clip of an old Philadelphia plane crash scene as the aftermath of a strike by INS Vikrant on the Karachi port during their live broadcast, Alt News reported.

3. A fidayeen attack that was not

Amid all this sabre-rattling, Aaj Tak news anchors, Sweta Singh and Anjana Om Kashyap, went on air to report that terrorists had begun a “fidayeen hamla”, or a suicide attack on an army unit in Rajouri. They did not attribute this information to any official. Nor were other details forthcoming.

Later, Army officials told the news agency, ANI, that such reports “were completely false”.

4. ‘Pakistani cities destroyed, PM in hiding’

A persistent theme of the misinformation campaign run from TV studios was the destruction and humiliation of Pakistan.

Regional channels were not left behind in this campaign.

Assamese news channel News Live, which has one of the highest viewership in the state, reported that 12 cities in Pakistan had been destroyed in an Indian attack. Not only that, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was hiding in a bunker to save his life, the channel claimed.

5. Pakistan’s fighter jets ‘down’, and ‘a pilot captured’

Several news handles uploaded a deepfake video of a Pakistani Army General, admitting the loss of two fighter jets.

The Deccan Chronicle website uploaded the AI generated fake video on its Twitter handle, claiming that “India shot down two Pakistani JF-17s and one F-16 on May 8” and said it had been “confirmed by DGISPR, spokesperson for Pakistan armed forces”.

Even India Today reported this claim during a discussion, citing a Pakistani army official.",1614,153,1746818943,https://scroll.in/article/1082189/from-the-fall-of-islamabad-to-an-attack-on-karachi-5-fake-stories-that-indian-tv-news-ran-with
1gzb368,india,"27M , Jobless, CSE grad: 4 years of bad choices & procrastination, Don't commit these mistakes and need your honest advice!!","

I graduated with a B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college in 2020. Since then, I've been stuck in a cycle of indecision and missed opportunities that I desperately need to break out of.

My story:
I had one backlog in college that kept me from most technical placements. Got an offer from an edtech company, but turned it down due to the role (customer care/sales) and hearing about the toxic work culture with 14-hour shifts. My father suggested taking it anyway and quitting if I didn't like it, but my ego got in the way.

Post-graduation, I've jumped from one ""perfect plan"" to another:
- Spent 6 months learning Japanese, hoping to work in Japan (gave up when it got difficult)
- Explored MS in Canada with a friend (he went, I got rejected due to low GPA)
- Got accepted for MS in Australia but couldn't justify the 60 lakh cost as a single child from a middle-class family....( also couldn't trust myself)
- Attempted multiple government exams and GATE, failed all

The brutal truth about my current situation:

- 4-year gap with only 1-2 years of internships to show( which is fake)

- Zero technical skills despite having a CSE degree (didn't maintain or improve what I learned in college)

- Poor communication skills
- No real-world work experience
- No projects or portfolio to show

- Been ""preparing"" for GATE 2025 for the past 10 months but haven't actually studied anything. Now only 2 months are left for the exam, and I literally don't know anything that could help me pass ( its me who told my father I will do it again despite failing it in 2024  *EGO*)

- My father, who lives away due to work, has high hopes for this GATE attempt, and I've let him believe I'm preparing well

The real problem isn't the opportunities - it's me. I procrastinate heavily, run from responsibilities, and have this constant need to find the ""perfect"" path that ""resonates"" with me. I keep thinking I'll give 200% once I find that perfect thing, but I never do. Meanwhile, my parents are patiently supporting me without complaint.

I'm not just academically behind - I lack basic professional skills. I can't even confidently say I'm good at anything right now. Every day I waste scrolling through my phone or playing games, knowing I'm digging myself deeper into this hole.

The worst part? I recognize these issues - my fear, lack of confidence, ego, and selfishness - but struggle to change. I've become emotionally neutral to everything, which scares me the most. I don't even feel bad anymore when I waste an entire day.

Looking for advice:
1. How do I break this cycle of procrastination and perfectionism?
2. What realistic options do I have with a 4-year gap, no skills, and a CSE degree?
3. Should I drop the GATE preparation since I have only 2 months left and focus on getting any job I can?
4. How do I develop basic employable skills from absolute zero?

Please be brutally honest. You can be as rude or mean as you want - I need this wake-up call. I've wasted my parents' time, money, and trust. I need to change, and I need to change now.

To the younger folks reading this: If you think your life is going nowhere, take my story as a warning. Don't end up like me. Each day you procrastinate, each opportunity you pass up because of ego, each skill you don't build - it all compounds. Four years ago, I was just like you, thinking I had time to figure things out. Now I'm 27, living with my mom, with no skills, no job, and no real prospects. Take action now, take whatever opportunities come your way, and don't let ego or fear hold you back.

I'm ready for your honest feedback, no matter how harsh. I need to wake up and take responsibility for my life before it's too late.









******************************************************


Edit : I never thought so many people would reply to my post. Your support through comments and DMs has been really overwhelming. I truly didn't expect this at all!

Reading your comments has been eye-opening for me. Many of you faced bigger problems and turned your lives around. Some of you are still fighting tougher battles than mine... This made me understand that although my problems feel something to me but they're incomparable . The major takeaway I get from you all is to *just start somewhere - even if it's a tiny step forward*.

Some of the things will resonate with me  - especially *""Procrastination will kill luck""* and *""Start small and work hard.""* I've made up my mind to study hard for GATE in these last two months (even if I fail). Additionally, I will look for any kind of work to start my career, regardless of how big or small it is, how hard it might be, or what society will think of me. I'll always focus on small steps rather than get overwhelmed by the bigger picture....

To the YOUNGER FOLKS: Please go through the comments. There's a HOLY GRAIL of information that can help you (many things are new to me too). If anyone wants to talk, you can DM me, and I will try my best to respond.

If I manage to turn my life around even by 20%, I will owe you a guys a big one . Even now, I am grateful to you all - thank you so much ❤️

Also, thanks to those who told me about ADHD. I will get it checked if things don't work out. I live in Delhi, by the way. If anyone has any good recommendations about where to get tested for ADHD or any doctors to suggest, please DM me.

1ii5wkv,india,"ZEPTO is run by thieves, liars and incompetent people.","**Background**

On Jan 22, I tried placing order on ZEPTO but it was failing due to technical glitch. I was using ZEPTO Wallet as payment mode. Eventually I used my credit cad directly and order went through.

BUT I didn't realise that money was deducted from ZEPTO wallet for those failed order until this week.

The amount is 1050, deducted twice, so 2100 Rs.

**The Incompetence**

I reached to customer care through chat explaining my issue. The replies I get -

>Upon verification, it has been observed that the amount has not yet been received by us. If you are unable to view this amount, please consider reaching out to the bank either by phone or by visiting in person.

I clearly mentioned the amount was deducted from ZEPTO wallet along with screenshot.

The person escalated to their senior, received a call from them and they agreed amount isn't refunded. They will do it by end of day. And will give 300 rs extra for inconvenience.

Few hours later, I received 300 Rs but with only 1 refund of 1050 Rs.

**The Liars**

I decided to directly email their support as I want to document the conversation. I explained the issue, attached screenshot of wallet ledger with deducted amount and refunds I received and asked to issue remaining amount.

The replies I get -

>If you are unable to view this amount, please consider reaching out to the bank either by phone or by visiting in person. You can then initiate a charge back, and the dispute team will investigate the matter for you. 

Clearly, comprehension is not their strong skill.

After back and forth multiple times -

>Upon verification, it has been observed that the amount has not yet been received by us.

Now they are now resorting to lie outright, AFTER refunding for 1 order but not both.

I escalated the issue to grievanceredressal (at) commodum (dot) in. The reply -

>We regret any inconvenience you may have had due to the refund discrepancy.Upon checking, we found that the amount was not deducted for these two order IDs. Unfortunately, we can only share this feedback with you.

The absolute thievery.

I am just baffled by how shitty their system is that they can't track a payment done by their OWN wallet, absolute lack of comprehension skill to understand the issue and find resolution.

In all the years of interacting with various customer cares, this one makes me angry BECAUSE OF ABSOLUTE LYING they have resorted to.

TL;DR - Zepto deducted 1050 twice for failed order from their wallet, refunded only 1, now lying amount was never deducted in first place and refused to give refund.

1h2faxe,india,Whoever says that India is better than developed countries where you have to do everything yourself is basically supporting labor exploitation in India?,"Hear my rant,

My sister runs a salon business and hires beauticians every 6 months. Recently, she was interviewing a girl aged 28 who works with a big brand salon. She informed her that she works from 10 am to 8 pm on 10,000 rs per month and has been given targets to bring business worth 50,000 rs every month by selling products/services to clients.

I feel sad that labor laws are so bad in developing countries like India that humans are not even treated like humans. I wonder even in tier-2 cities what a person with 10k salary can do about his/her future. I know you can say that 10k is way more than what a rag picker earns and all that. My point is - this person or many people like her are giving 10 hours of every day with no bonuses on Diwali but still have no future and the reason is - There is no minimum wage concept that is followed by businessmen. There is no gov body who audits and makes sure that people in unorganized business are paid well.

I was talking to my client in Netherlands and he informed me that even a plumber charges 150$ for an hour in their country. Even if blue collar jobs are paid well and yes its true that no ones wants their kids to be blue collar worker but those who don't have the luxury to afford an engineering/doctor education still have minimum wage concept in place to support their families.

Here in India, poor hard-working people are exploited by those who are in power. And that includes middle/upper middle class people like us.

1jo6y5y,india,"WTF, Why is Flying to Dubai Cheaper Than Flying to Assam?","No joke, it’s cheaper to fly from Delhi to Dubai than from Delhi to Guwahati. How does that even make sense? Because our government doesn’t just want taxes, they want taxes on taxes, cess on surcharges, and fees for existing.

Thanks, Adani. Remember when privatizing airports was supposed to make things better? LOL. Now, the winner isn’t the company that runs airports well, it’s the one that promises to squeeze the most money out of YOU, the passenger.  

Here’s all the bullshit you’re paying for:  
UDF – Because you should pay for the airport’s existence, obviously.  
ADF – Because UDF wasn’t enough robbery.  
GST – Because taxing a tax is innovation. 
Security Charge – Paying to get harassed at security.  
Convenience Fee – The convenience of getting scammed.  
Fuel Surcharge – Because global oil prices are your problem.  
Walking Tax – Okay, not official, but might as well be, since you pay for walking through a metal detector.

Meanwhile, in Reality Tourism? Dead. Who wants to visit India when half your trip cost is just taxes? Jobs? Lol. But hey, at least we’re busy fighting over Mughals instead of jobs. Happiness Index? We’re below Afghanistan. But sure, let’s keep arguing about temples and mosques.  
Inflation?  Every time you buy something, you’re doing mental math on how much the govt is stealing from you.  

Babur isn’t charging you UDF. Aurangzeb isn’t slapping GST on your chai. The real villain is today’s government, inventing new ways to suck money out of you while giving nothing in return, no jobs, no healthcare, just more taxes.  

We really need to ask why is flying so damn expensive? Where are the jobs? The hospitals Why are airports sold to whoever can scam passengers the most?  

Stop falling for communal nonsense. Your life isn’t hard because of history, it’s hard because of today’s tax terrorism. Either wake up and demand better, or keep getting robbed silently.

1gnm3gt,india,NEED ADVISE!! Bata Store sold me Leather shoes by saying its Synthetic Leather,"Hi folks

So I bought a pair of formal shoes for Rs 2500 on Oct 30 from a Bata store(not franchisee) in Jaipur. I specifically demanded for Non-leather/Synthetic/PU leather shoes and from the given options bought one. I checked with them multiple times if the pair I'm buying is not made from animal skin and they assured me.

Then I wore the shoes the first time for a day and it gave me severe shoebite and hence I took it today at the store to exchange/return. There, by chance one salesman told me that its proper leather shoes. I enquired with the store manager and he assured me that its synthetic leather(he even showed me the product page on Bata website).

But I actually read the product description which the Store Manager himself opened and it was clearly mentioned ""FULL GRAIN LEATHER"" which by all accounts is made of animal skin(correct me if I'm wrong) and nowhere its mentioned PU leather. I've attached the product description and material in image 2 & 3.

I asked for refund but they told me refund won't be possible but I can exchange it citing shoebite. However, not enough Synthetic options were there on the store so I visited another store he referred and they had an option priced at Rs 1800 which I selected(out of the limited options).

But now the issue is that instead of returning the Rs 700 difference(2500-1800) they are telling me to buy some other item of worth 700 or more. They're not even giving any voucher.

I feel defrauded because I've been sold an comparitvely expensive shoe by misinforming and misguiding me. It's crucial to me that I don't buy genuine leather shoes. Now, they're forcing me to buy stuff I don't need or want.

What should be my course of action? How can I escalate this to get the full refund or atleast get the 700 Rs in cashback? Should I tag them on twitter(does it work) or write mails or what? The customer care number is not picking calls rn.

Key points:

1. Sold shoes through malicious misinformation
2. Date of purchase: Oct 30
3. As per them, I can exchange only within 15 days
4. In their claim policy, nothing is mentioned about how the difference should be paid in case of exchange(I've attached the policy card they display)

1lkdoxo,india,Why can't women exist in peace at night????,"Okay, I’m literally shaking and crying in frustration and disgust. I don't even know if this is the right sub, but I need to vent or I’m going to throw something.

I’m 19F, recently done with my engineering entrance exams and finally breathing after what felt like a lifetime. Tonight, I just wanted a normal dinner hoodie on, messy bun, sneakers, zero makeup, just some peace and dosa with an old friend (guy, school buddy, not that it should matter).

We were at this dosa joint around 10:30 PM, light rain, the city felt quiet and kind for once, until it didn’t.

Three guys showed up. Drunk, loud, and already staring. I tried to ignore them at first, but the comments started. Nothing clever, just the usual grossness. One of them muttered loud enough “Rich girls like her are always looking for attention.”

It was like a switch flipped.

I told them to back off firm, not dramatic. They laughed. One of them tugged at my hoodie string like it was some kind of joke. That moment I’ve never felt rage like that in public before. The disrespect, the entitlement, the sheer shamelessness.

I stood up, plate still in hand, heart pounding. They didn’t stop until I pulled out my phone and said I was calling the cops. Of course, they ran.

The cops showed up late, asked me questions that made me feel more judged than protected. My grandparents told me to ""let it go"" and not go out so late again.

But why?

Why is it my timing, my outfit, my tone, my decision to eat outside that’s questioned, not their behavior?

I’m so tired. Not scared, just tired. Of having to be alert all the time. Of having to manage male egos in public. Of not being able to do something as basic as grab food at night without some man making me feel unsafe in my own city.

I’m filing a report tomorrow. I’m not letting this slide.

I wanted some peace for fuck sake!!!!! Got harassment instead. Welcome to being a woman in India.",1314,120,1750876545,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lkdoxo/why_cant_women_exist_in_peace_at_night/
1mh7ahe,india,From 3 NEET drops to running my own business - my journey,"hey reddit,

wanted to share my story cuz i know theres others out there who might be going thru something similar.

so i spent like 4 years preparing for neet. took 3 drops, gave it everything i had each time. but it just wasnt ment to be - couldnt clear the exam. after that third attempt i was honestly lost af. everyone around me was moving forward with thier medical dreams and i felt like i was completly stuck.

the anxiety hit me hard after the 3rd drop. like really bad anxiety for about 6 months. couldnt sleep properly, always worried about my future. it was the worst time of my life tbh.

thats when i decided to try something completly different. started an instagram page thinking i could make some money online. spoiler alert - it didnt work out lol. the page never took off and i was back to square one.

but instead of giving up i got curious about why some online bussinesses work and others dont. thats how i stumbled into digital marketing. started learning everything i could - meta ads, google ads, seo, the whole package. learning new stuff actually helped me get out of that anxious phase.

what started as a desperate attempt to make some money online turned into something i actualy got good at. im now running a sustainable ecommerce bussiness selling digital products and im currently working on developping a web app.

looking back those neet failures werent realy failures - they were redirects. i never thought id be an entrepeneur but here i am at 23.

to anyone whos dealing with repeated failures or feeling like thier behind in life - sometimes the path your supposed to be on isnt the one you originaly planned. keep trying different things until something clicks.

just wanted to put this out there incase it helps someone whos where i was a few years ago.

thanks for reading guys

1mmcvlg,india,Lenovo is running scam (images given as proof in comment),"(personal experience) **As a rakhi gift**, I bought Lenovo Tab 10 days back, paid for it but it is not shipped yet. I was so excited to gift Tab but Lenovo made it so worse and frustrating honestly! (proof given in comments via drive link)

# SCAM DETAILS

1. Ordered on 1st August, the date of shipment showing on the official website was 4th August
2. Nothing shipped on 4th, on 5th August, the date changed from 4th to 8th August. When I asked about this delay, the team told me that they do not have stock at their warehouse and told me that it will be shipped on or before 8th August so I should not cancel my prepaid order and wait for an update in next 24 hours
3. I did not receive any update, so on 6th, I sent them an email seeking clarity, they told me it is because of operational constraint and gave me new date for shipment which was 9th August (on website it was still showing 8th August)
4. Yesterday, on 9th, the shipment date on official website again changed from 8th August to 11th August now! When I called them. they said that product will be shipped by 9th EOD only.
5. Today, on 10th, product is not shipped yet, date of shipment is 11th August

**ALL THIS WHILE WHEN LENOVO DID NOT HAVE PRODUCT TO SHIP, THEY CONTINUED ACCEPTING NEW ORDERS UNDER FREEDOM OFFER SALE. THE PRODUCT I ORDERED, TILL DATE, IS STILL SHOWN AVAILABLE AND READY FOR SHIPMENT (image as proof given in comments)**

why can't brands be upfront about the inventory? if you cannot deliver, why are you even promising by giving false information?

This was supposed to be Rakhi Gift, Lenovo has made this a sour experience. This is in such a bad taste and the most frustrating and annoying thing is - **THEY KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE STOCK, STILL THEY ARE ACCEPTING NEW ORDERS AND SHOWING ON WEBSITE THAT THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE**",2,5,1754813050,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1mmcvlg/lenovo_is_running_scam_images_given_as_proof_in/
1mnhxk2,india,"19F – Lost father, family of 5, ₹33 lakh home loan, risk of losing house – I’m desperate for guidance(please read full and help!!!!)","PS: i am so overwhelemed with the support and replies i have gotten here. thankyou so much all.... whenever i get a chance i would try to reciprocate this to others in this community.

I honestly never thought I’d be writing something like this online, but I’m running out of options and time.

I’m 19, in my second year of [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) CSE at a small tier-3 college. I have 3 younger sisters and my mom. A few months ago, I lost my dad — he was the only earning member in the family.

We’ve got around a **30 lakh home loan** on the only house we live in. Because of years of family politics, we lost all our savings. Now, the bank wants us to either start paying EMIs right away or vacate. We’ve filed a case in the Trivandrum court — that might give us 1–2 years, maybe another 1–2 years if it goes to the High Court… but in the worst case, they could tell us to leave anytime.

My mom’s uneducated, my sisters are still in school, and I’m the only one who can eventually earn — but right now I’m just a student with no big-paying skills yet. I do have a scholarship covering my college fees, but apart from that, we have no income at all.  
ps: we are all female left in the house so going out with no male figure and staying in a remote area without  market and all is a problem. crime against women are so much so our society is safest option. thats why i am very tensed to sell this house. i need to collect some 20 lakh in a year or so as settlement amount and we can have this house and my mother can cater the bussiness again meanwhile my sister and me can do jobs or freelancing to alteast to make our education and daily expenses functional along with the emergency fund we have.

I’m not trying to keep the house without paying. I fully plan to repay every rupee. I just need time — at least 4–5 years — to finish my degree, get a decent job, and then start clearing the loan.

I’m not here for sympathy. I’m just… lost. I don’t know how to handle this without losing the house right away. I don’t know how to survive the next few years until I can stand on my own feet. I’m willing to work, learn, do multiple jobs — I just don’t know what’s the fastest and most realistic path. I also don’t want my sisters’ education to stop because of this.

If any person or organisation helps us now, I swear I’ll work and repay them in the future. This isn’t charity for me — it’s literally a lifeline to keep my family safe until I can manage on my own.

Anything that can help-

* Crowdfunding guidance or organisations that can support temporarily
* Crowdfunding Link: [http://m-lp.co/nandini-39?utm\_medium=campaign\_page\_share&utm\_source=copy](http://m-lp.co/nandini-39?utm_medium=campaign_page_share&utm_source=copy)
* Legal advice on how to delay eviction
* NGOs or individuals who help families in such crises
* Job leads (remote/freelance/internships I can start right now)

I’ll be real — there have been days I’ve felt like giving up completely, but I can’t. My sisters need me, and I can’t let their lives collapse because of this.

If anyone’s been through something similar, or knows a contact, platform, organisation, or even the right next step — please let me know.

Thanks for reading this.

1lpt4z0,india,Suggestions needed: What small business could I run from my home shop?,"Hi everyone,

I’m exploring new ideas for a small business in our family’s 10x20 ft shop in Delhi, right across from two government schools and next to an MCD colony. My parents used to run a grocery store here, but the footfall has gone down lately due to online grocery apps, and they’re thinking of either renting it out or repurposing it.

The shop has:

* steady school footfall
* local residents from the colony
* people from nearby well-off colony
* several gyms nearby
* 50 sq ft extra storage space
* electricity, with plumbing possible

My parents can supervise day-to-day operations, and I can hire 1–2 staff if needed. I want to build something practical, ideally with good margins and steady demand, but not overly complex to manage.

**I’d really value your suggestions on:**

* What kind of business would fit best in this area?
* What products or services do you think would sell well here?
* Any challenges or lessons I should keep in mind before investing?

Open to any creative or realistic ideas — I don’t want to get stuck in the same middle-class grocery routine if there’s a better opportunity. Thanks so much for your thoughts, Delhi! 🙏

**TL;DR:** Family shop (10x20 ft, near schools and colony) needs a new small business idea. Parents can help supervise. Open to suggestions for practical, steady-income businesses instead of the old grocery format.",3,8,1751454933,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lpt4z0/suggestions_needed_what_small_business_could_i/
1kcjx61,india,Significant decline in children's behavior in India,"Hello.

I am a US based ABCD who attended a wedding for the first time in almost 10 years. 

I visit India every 1-2 years, and especially this trip at the wedding, most children had no manners.

It got to the point where children aged 3-8 were running around and wreaking havoc near where the cerimonies were happening (climbing over barriers, throwing around various objects, and yelling/hitting if they aren't given attention). The parents seemed to not mind at all, and no one spoke up.

Even at another point in a hotel room, a child was hitting other adults, and no one seemed to be bothered by this.
  
Has there been a significant decline in parental discipline in the new generation of parents? When I grew up and attended any sort of family functions, the standards for behavior were significantly higher. 

I would genuinely be terrified of my parents seeing me misbehave in the slightest during such an important event, and the kids I grew up with of the same age were also similarly scared of their parents reactions if they acted like this.",1123,156,1746134255,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1kcjx61/significant_decline_in_childrens_behavior_in_india/
1mlkrkc,india,Feel absolutely dejected and disgusted #VoteChori,"Today, I’m absolutely done. I knew things were bad behind the scenes and I always knew there was fraud and corruption going on but I genuinely (perhaps naively) believed that at least our voting system, the very foundation of our democracy was not compromised. 

Everyone needs to take this seriously, just running away isn’t good enough. We have such a beautiful country, so much variety and such a rich culture. How could we have let this happen? Hate politics and this demonic party has been a cancer upon our once beautiful country. Yeah, it was definitely not perfect. But I was alive for 2 decades of Congress rule and this is something different. 

I remember being young and watching comedians at 8 pm on prime time TV making fun of Sonia Gandhi and MMS whilst dressed up as them. No ED raids, no institutional bullying. I remember after 26/11 when there were resignations. At least some accountability. Where is the now? How many terrorist attacks have happened on their watch and who has resigned? 

I don’t remember r**ists being garlanded, I don’t remember this level of hatred among citizens, I don’t remember hatred being peddled openly and brazenly just for votes. It’s horrible, the air has gotten worse, the roads are terrible, the infrastructure is crumbling. Bridges are collapsing and people die. No accountability. Forests and mangroves are being destroyed, the air will only get worse. 

Our neighbours used to be our friends. The foreign policy that I myself used to praise a few years ago has been an abject failure. Now each of our neighbours is straying away from us, into China’s hands. We’re isolated in our own backyard. When 26/11 happened, Obama met MMS, condemned Pakistan, publicly stated that they need to stop housing terrorists. When Pahalgam happened what did the US president say? “Oh India and Pakistan that was a bad one, both our good friends were looking into it” and boom Pakistan got an 8bn dollar loan from the IMF (US has the heaviest vote there).  Our foreign policy is a joke. 

People rejoice over our 4tn+ dollar economy. “We’ve crossed Japan to become the 4th largest economy” they say. What are we getting from that? Who benefits? How do people live in Japan and how do we live here? What’s the per capita? And don’t tell me about population. China has similar population and 7x the per capita. Enough excuses. We have a class of oligarchs who control the government‘s decision in significant ways. Enriching themselves and keeping us poor. Company Raj never left. 

For me this was the final straw. No I don’t want to leave and run away. I love India. I’m a patriot. I can’t stand what has become of our country. Sorry I had to rant. I love all of you who read until here ❤️ whether you agree with me or not.

1lmqume,india,"Went to Allahabad DM Office for a routine notice. Got extorted, assaulted, and barely walked out. Here’s what happened","I’m a final-year law student. Yesterday, I went to the Allahabad District Magistrate’s office to collect two routine notices under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act — on behalf of a bank, through an enforcement agency. I thought it would be bureaucratic hell. I didn’t think it would turn into physical hell.

I had to get two notices — one from the City Magistrate and the other from the Upper Nigam Magistrate.

The second one (Upper Nigam) — I managed to get it, but only after bribing the clerk with ₹500 in cash and 4 sachets of tobacco. That was the unofficial “fee” to get a file moved from one dusty table to another. That’s how normalized corruption is — no shame, no hesitation. Just a smirk and “paise de jao.”

The real nightmare started at the City Magistrate’s side.

The Reader there straight-up denied receiving any dispatched order. I followed the chain, traced it to the GC Room inside the DM premises, and found out the truth: they never dispatched the order at all. It had been sitting there for over a month.

When I calmly asked them to do their job — nothing aggressive, nothing offensive — one of them said:

“Main sarkari naukar hoon, kisi ke baap ka naukar nahi. Jo karna hai kar lo.”

I took out my phone to record that line, because it was absurd and illegal. That’s when the room exploded.

At least 20 men — some staff, some goons, I can’t say — cornered me, smashed my phone, slapped and punched me, and made me delete everything. One tore up a file on the desk and accused me of damaging government property. They threatened to file an FIR against me. Even said “You think your law books will save you?”

It was on the verge of turning into a lynching.
And there were no CCTV cameras in that room — of course not. That’s not a bug. It’s a feature.

I barely escaped — bruised, shaken, and humiliated.

Later, one of the same people who attacked me followed me to the Nigam Magistrate’s office and started asking questions like “Who are you?”, “In what capacity are you here?”, “You interns come and act like you run the place.”

They mocked me for “making videos,” saying things like “Even a normal person would go insane if you did that to him.”
They weren’t even hiding their arrogance. They were proud of it.

⸻

This isn’t a sob story. I’m not here to say feel bad for me.
I’m here to say:
This is the DM office of a major city in Uttar Pradesh.
If this is how they treat someone who knows the law, who’s been in courts, who knows the procedure —
then what chance does a common man have?


And no, I’m not filing a complaint. Because I know exactly what’ll happen:
	•	Best case: someone gets suspended for a week.
	•	Worst case: I get blacklisted from every courtroom and department for being “that kid who made trouble.”

That’s not justice.
That’s survival.

TLDR: Went to DM office for routine Section 14 notices. Bribed one clerk with ₹500 and tobacco. Got assaulted by 20 people in GC Room for trying to record refusal of duty. Phone smashed. Threatened with FIR. No CCTV. No accountability. Welcome to the system.

1lrc0mb,india,Received trial-used shoes from Myntra. Complaint ignored. What are my options?,"I ordered a pair of Van Heusen loafers from Myntra, expecting a brand-new product. What I received instead was clearly a *trial-used* pair — likely from a local store. There were signs of wear, the packaging was not sealed properly, and it felt like a returned item being passed off as new.

I raised a complaint on **27th June (same day as delivery)**, but Myntra **closed the complaint without resolving it**. I had to raise a **second complaint on 29th June**, and since then, I've provided **clear images and full details**.

Despite calling **3-4 times**, all I get is:  
*""Please wait 24 more hours.""*  
It’s now been over a **week**, and still no action from Myntra’s end.

This is a clear case of delivering a used product under the pretext of new.

# Has anyone here faced something similar?

How can I escalate this — either legally (Consumer Court?) or via any effective platform where Myntra actually responds? Also tagging u/VanHeusenInd for awareness.

Appreciate any guidance or shared experiences.

1lg18dh,india,"Swiggy Is Running a Scam — No Accountability, Just Delay Tactics and Forced Cancellations","I’m a regular Swiggy customer and I’ve had enough of their pathetic service and shady practices.

Every time there’s an issue — wrong food, missing items, late deliveries — Swiggy's response is always the same: stall, delay, and then say, “Sorry, your support window has expired.” It’s a scammy tactic to avoid refunds and dodge accountability.

They’ll even call you pretending they’re going to resolve the issue, and once you explain everything, they’ll casually say, “Sorry, this isn’t my department.”
Then why did you call me in the first place promising a resolution?
It’s clear their goal is to waste your time until the complaint window closes and they can officially deny the issue.

So I started using Cash on Delivery (COD) just to protect myself. I now check the order before paying. And if something’s wrong? I refuse the order — because I’m not paying for Swiggy’s mistakes.

And here’s the worst part:
If you try to cancel a bad order, they’ll force a cancellation charge on you, even when it’s clearly their fault. You either accept broken service or lose more money. It's a trap that leaves customers feeling powerless.

I’m tired of Swiggy’s tricks and lies. We’re paying real money and getting zero accountability in return.

Swiggy needs to be called out and held responsible — not just for their pathetic customer service, but for how they exploit time, deflect responsibility, and trap users with bogus policies.

1l9io76,india,"The suspected scams run by telecom companies are mentioned below, kindly share your experiences if you have faced them as well.","So firstly when your service validity is nearing its end, sometimes the telecom company doesn't connect your call playing a recording that falsely states your service validity has ended and you can't place the call, even though you still have 2 or more days left for the validity to end. 
I have personally experienced this and have to recharge over an already existing plan even before it's expiry just to connect the call.  The internet also works sh..y at the end of the plan forcing you to recharge.

Secondly, sometimes when i turn on the internet after recharging, the device still does not show internet service as expected after the recharge , so one panicks , turns the internet on and off several times yet there's still no internet. Then out of frustration , you recharge another internet specific add on plan. Another suspected scam trick forcing you to recharge.

Thirdly, the telecom companies only provide expensive combo plans and one is forced to buy all of the services even if they want to use only one, eg my grandmother has a button phone and uses only calling feature yet when i have to recharge her button phone , i have to choose between the expensive combo packs with mandatory Internet service in all. 

Many who work from home already pay for the wifi at home - recharging an expensive combo pack when you're only going to use one service  makes no sense. 

Lastly earlier when I needed to go out for a day i used to recharge the 1 day pack - now it's an add on plan which can be used only with an existing plan, so you're forced to recharge for 28 days maximum even if you want to use services for just 1 day.

1lfbzcf,india,Born Poor in India Feels Like the Biggest Sin,"Hey Reddit, I’m M, stuck in a small town in India, still living with my parents. Feels pathetic, right? Like I should be out there, landing a dream job, taking my folks on trips, making them proud. Instead, I’m here, drowning in self-doubt, with dead eyes that scream “failure” every time I look in the mirror.

I graduated with a CS degree from a college that, let’s be real, isn’t winning any awards. Been working part-time as a computer assistant for 3.5 years—6000Rs a month, contractual, soul-sucking work that’s more unlearning than learning ( I also earn 1000-2000 rs more by other side works) . Tomorrow, I’m quitting. It’s like I’ve been stuck in a loop, too scared to apply for real jobs because I’m convinced I’ll never measure up. “Prepare more, then apply,” I tell myself. Three years later, still preparing. Still nothing.

Growing up, I was the “smart kid.” Friends hyped me up: “You’ll get a great job!” I didn’t buy it, always doubting if I was good enough. Now? Everyone else has it all—jobs, businesses, happy families, lives that look like Instagram reels. Me? I’ve got nothing. No job, no girlfriend, no relationships. I’ve never betrayed anyone, always been the “nice guy,” and what’s my reward? Being called “easy.” Ouch.

Nights are the worst. I lie awake, wondering if more suffering’s around the corner. I’m grinding daily—AI/ML, Python, Full Stack, DevOps, LinkedIn profiles, projects. But my eyes? They’re lifeless, like they’re already bracing for the next failure. I’ve lost weight, probably from stress and sleepless nights. My dreams—poof, gone. I wanted to be the guy who makes his parents proud, buys them gifts, travels with them. Instead, I’m a loser chasing validation.

I’ve sworn off marriage. Why drag someone else into this mess? I can’t even make myself happy, let alone a partner. My parents push for a government job, but that’s not me. I love computers, gadgets, art, creativity—always have. I want to build something, not push papers. But every step feels like I’m running into a wall.

I got my first phone at 18, teaching kids in town to scrape together the cash. My first laptop? Age 21, half my money, half my dad’s. I’m still learning, still fighting, but it feels like I’m living without living. I used to thank God every day for keeping me alive, even bribing Him with fruits to ease my suffering. But now? Feels like my file’s corrupted in His divine database.

I wanted to be the guy others rely on, the one who creates jobs, not begs for them. Instead, I’m comparing myself to people in worse situations just to feel a flicker of motivation. “At least I’m not that bad off.” Pathetic, right? I’m sorry to myself for failing. For not having the chill college life, the fancy institute, the resources. For not making my parents proud in a moment that matters.

Thanks for reading this rant. I’m not giving up, but damn, it’s hard to keep hoping.

TL;DR: Born poor in India, stuck in a dead-end job, no hope, no dreams, just grinding and failing. Feels like poverty is my biggest sin.

1j4cxfn,india,Are these IT scams running in india openly with government approval?,"(WhatsApp screenshot of a former intern trainer who got fired)

The above screenshot is from a friend of mine who got into a company Einfratech systems India. This company hired him through a 3 months college program run by a organisation namely Nasscom (National Association of Software and Service Companies is an Indian non-governmental trade association and advocacy group that primarily serves the Indian technology industry.

Founded in 1988, NASSCOM operates as a nonprofit organization and serves as a key entity within the Indian technology sector.).

While he was in program he was getting skills for cybersecurity along with his 120+ classmates. After 3 months placements started and there were a number of companies willing to take them in. As per my friend the questions were easy and mostly were designed to check ones confidence and english.

My friend got selected in Einfratech systems 2 months ago. Company promised Paid internship, work laptop, work from office with other benefits like any other company does.

After joining the HR seemed confused about the how the onboarding is going to go. They didn't respond to queries of the new joiners. After a month of no information about company's legitimacy and onboarding process, one of the intern send out the mail to various government/non government organisations for help or complaint.

After this incident they found out about the person who used fake name and fired him along with who ever raised concerns about the legitimacy of the company.

It's been two months, no one has received any salary slips yet, they are willingly giving impossible time consuming tasks with 1 hr deadline and saying that they will share a warning mails with people who fail to complete the designated tasks. Whoever received the warning mail is not going to get any salary for the month.

According to my friend, The work they are getting during this internship period is mostly related to their company's website which they are referring to as ""client"". Seems like they are going to get their work done and fire them all, free labour i suppose.

Deliberately delaying task and last minute work to make a list of people who didn't complete the task on time and keeping their salaries on hold.

I wonder what else is happening under Governments nose in the name of Non-profit.

1md00fm,india,My mummy refuses to let me(22F) move to Bangalore for a job. I am from Surat. How to deal with this situation?,"
Hi Reddit. I’m(22F) from Surat and recently got a good job offer in Bangalore. It’s a big opportunity for me as it's offering better pay, better exposure, and a chance to grow. But my mom is completely against it.

I’ve tried to talk to her three times now, and every time she reacts by shouting and shutting down the conversation. She is not even hearing me out. We live in a joint family, so it’s not like she’d be left alone. She has people around her- my siblings, in-laws, my cousins, everyone.

There's a little situation that happened, my cousin brother(25M) recently came back from Bangalore after finishing his graduation. He could not find a good job. (P.S.: He was living with his mom's side family)

But my mom keeps saying, “Your cousin brother came back from Bangalore to stay with family, and now you're leaving yours for a job?” What she doesn’t know is that my cousin came back because the people he was living with in Bangalore didn’t treat him well. They gave him no support, so he had to return. But I haven’t told her this yet, she already gets angry so fast. I’m scared that saying more will only make things worse.

For context, I don’t have a father. I’ve always tried to be responsible. I’m not running away from my responsibilities; I want to take this job to support her and the family financially. I even told her I’d visit often, call every day, and stay connected. But nothing is helping me to make her understand. She’s emotionally shutting me down.

I feel stuck. Like I’m being forced to choose between: Being the “good child” who stays home, or being the grown-up who takes a step forward for a better future.

Any advice? How do I deal with this kind of guilt, especially when it’s not even logical?",382,172,1753859818,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1md00fm/my_mummy_refuses_to_let_me22f_move_to_bangalore/

1mc5ai0,india,How I Uncovered a Pyramid Scheme Over a Cup of Coffee,"
Something weird happened recently. One of my office friends randomly mentioned during a call that he had been to Malaysia. Curious, I asked why, and he said it was a work trip related to a startup he's involved with. I casually told him to let me know if there are similar opportunities since I'm looking to change my company. A week later, he called back saying, “It was actually open for you, if you’re serious about earning an extra income.” Sounded like a legit startup thing, so I said okay.

He said I’d get a call from his “senior.” That guy called, asked about my background, and said, “Let’s meet, these things can’t be explained properly over the phone.” I agreed. But I fell sick and went home for two weeks. After coming back to Hyderabad, I told a friend about it and he immediately said, “Bro, this is a scam. They contacted me too. I backed out because of the money they ask for.” That’s when I connected the dots. These guys never reveal the business upfront unless you say you’re ready to invest. I Googled about it, found similar scam reports, and decided to go to the meeting just to see what happens.

We met at café. I asked if I could bring a friend who's interested  and my office friend was like, “No bro, this is exclusive for you.” Huge red flag. At the café, he hyped up his “senior”  said he’s from NIT, now working as an SDE in a top MNC. That guy arrived and started asking about my family, hobbies, interests very friendly chat. Then he says, “My senior, who’s like the ChatGPT of this business,” is on his way. I nearly laughed out loud but stayed serious. Meanwhile, he flexed that my friend also have businesses in all metro cities, Singapore, Malaysia, and that the company is registered under his name. 😒

Then comes the “senior’s senior.” Super dramatic entry. Acting busy, constantly on calls, and when he finally sits, he says, “You’ll need to invest ₹5.5 lakhs.” Before that, he starts warming me up with nonsense like, “Even your job today is the result of an investment in education. Without investing, no one earns.” I asked him what kind of business it is so I could talk to my dad. His reply? “Don’t tell your parents, they’ll ask questions you can’t answer. They just want to keep you safe.” Then he suggested I take a loan even borrow from local lenders and gave an insane example: someone who took a 36% interest loan from goons, and now owns 16–18 plots in Dubai and drives a Maserati. 🤡

He even made a “plan” for me: invest ₹4.7L, keep ₹80K to pay EMIs for 5–6 months, and earn ₹50K/month from their “business” to cover it. I again asked, “What is this business exactly?” and he said, “There’s no point telling you unless you’re ready to invest.” At that point, I knew it was all BS. I told them I’d think about it, drank my cappuccino (the only ROI from that meeting), and left.

Out of curiosity, I later called my office friend and asked if they have a website or any official documentation since they claim to be running businesses internationally. His reply? “It’s confidential, bro. We can’t share anything unless you’re ready.” I pushed a bit and he said, “If you're seriously interested, I’ll schedule another meetup.” That was the final nail. No transparency, no website, no docs just sketchy meetups and manipulation.

TL;DR: If someone hypes up a secret “business opportunity” but won’t tell you what it is unless you invest ₹5+ lakhs, it’s probably a scam. Don’t fall for the drama, fake success stories, and emotional manipulation. Stay sharp.

1jri5tj,india,Making cities clean - one run at a time,"So I see a lot posts of how European cities are clean. One of the things that I see is how the people contribute to it. People go on runs, or take their children for a walk, and on seeing some wrappers or litter, they themselves pick those up, or teach their kids to do the same. For sure, there are cities with areas as dirty as it can be, but that's most of it is clean.

Before anyone comes in and says, you can't change things on your own, or how people have previously failed, I just want to ask and know, what if you saw one person, pick litter up, when going on a run? 

Being a millennial, I feel we were never taught about keeping the streets or parks clean (and even if we were taught that, we didn't). But I do feel, this generation of ours, knowing what is happening in the world, from cleanliness to climate change, are more capable of changing things around them. 

Again, I'm not asking or saying someone should do this, but how would you feel if you saw someone going about cleaning stuff up? Would you help them out if you saw that? Would you join them for a run where they go about cleaning a small part of the place they all live in?

Sorry in advance if someone thinks this is super stupid, I will most probably take this post down, but just wanted to hear people's thoughts given how negative the country and the world has recently been.

as the door is wide open, dad, having his baby boy in front of him bends down, wrapping his hand around his baby boy from behind, now y'all must be assuming he's gonna pick the little guy up and help him get down right? well no. dad pulls out his baby boys weiner and makes him pee. now we all know that ac trains doors are usually open for a very generous amount of time, but saying that little boy carrier a big bladder would be an understatement, again. as time was clicking, with each second passing by, we were all holding our breadths hoping for it to end before the two doors meet again.

soon the time came when the doors were to close, for the train to be on its way, yet the little guy with his steady stream of salt water, determined to empty his bladder then and there, for a good night's sleep, was no where close to an end. this is the moment where mom steps in to assist her husband to complete 'big strong bladder' challenge, trying her best to keep the door open with both her hands, unfortunately for her the doors mechanism were stronger than her.

thats when a stranger steps in to assist them couple at a mission that no where concerned his game of life, yet he decided to intervene and became an external force. together the stranger, and the little guys mom fought the door successfully as the dad holds his little boys weiner, determined to not let go off of it no matter what. saying that stranger was a godly force for for that couple would be again, an understatement cause in exchange of his unconpensated selfless act, all he got was pee on his shoes and pants that bounced off of the platform as his thick stream of pee hit the surface.

I’m facing a serious issue and need advice. I run a legitimate food processing company, and recently I’ve been threatened by a BJP Cabinet Minister. The problem started because the minister’s brother-in-law and his friend own land adjacent to my factory. Now, they’re demanding I either shut down my operations or pay 4 times the value of their plot — completely unjustified.

When I didn’t give in, they filed a false complaint through a helpline. To make matters worse, the minister himself is now writing official letters against me, misusing his position to pressure me.

This feels like clear extortion and abuse of power. I’ve done nothing illegal and have all valid approvals for my factory.

1k6qazi,india,Men on living with their parents after marriage.,"Recently a lot of reels have been circulating around social media where the interviewers ask girls and boys whether they would like to live with their spouses separately or with move in with their in laws (or would want to live with their parents after marriage). As observed, men don't want to live with their in laws but expect their wives to do so, any reason why this is so prevalent yet? 

Men's arguments on this-

My parents have given me birth, spent on my education, brought me up, it is my duty to take care of them. 
- Girl's parents haven't done the same? 

It's not like we are abandoning her parents, they will be taken care of too.
- One set of parents will get food and morning cup of tea from her daughter in law, the other set of parents will be visited by their son in law once a month, equality died a hundred times.

Her brother will take care of her parents, I will take care of mine. 
- Gender roles again, it is the response of both equally, and what if she does not have a brother? Things like these are what push families to have a male child, either by killing daughters in womb, or by reproducing continuously up and until a boy is born. Also, this puts financial pressure on boys and they become a retirement plan for their parents.

If she is a single child, or does not have a brother then I will be eager to contribute in taking care of her parents. 
- So if she has a brother, she should dump all responsibility on her brother?

I wouldn't mind living with both set of parents, why should she?
- Sure, you won't have restrictions like not wearing shorts, waking up early, etc. It clearly ain't the same for both. Men are treated like kings around their in laws, women are not. Women's parents will be happy seeing that her husband is contributing to housework just the way their daughter is contributing in earning, husband's parents will say she is making our child work, since household chores are expected from women and not from men. And this solution works only if both are single children, if there are siblings, it'll still be an issue as to with whom the parents will live.

This is how it has always been, it is a part of our culture.
- As far as my religion (Hinduism) is concerned, no religious book which is followed to this date mentions that it is obligatory for a women to live with her in laws. Sati was a ritual too, does that make it right? I am not saying that both are the same, but any practice or rule which applies to only one gender is oppressive. Just because something is a ritual (pratha) does not mean it is God's order, most of these are made by people, and are a system influenced by socio-economic and geopolitics factors rather than religion. Not following these or changing these are not harming religion in any possible way. Religious books in my religion, for example, the Bhagvad Geeta, are a guide, a manual, and not a rule book. It does not threaten that is you do not follow so and so, so and so will happen, it just tells us what is the right thing to do, what we should do is our own conscious and we all have a free will. Culture is ever changing, ever evolving. So many things were not originally a part of our culture but now they are inseparable. For example, tea was introduced to India by the British in the nineteenth century, to overcome the monopoly of Chinese production. Not originally our thing, but now a part of it.

Who can afford a new house in this economy? 
- Expect the wife to contribute and both of you chip in money equally to buy a new house, if not possible, rent. 

But parents are old and need help. 
- If possible, they can be shifted to the same city from hometown, both set of parents can live closeby in a residential complex or on different floors in the same apartment. Again this too can cause an issue if both the man and the woman aren't single children and have siblings. Don't know what else could be a solution.

You wouldn't say the same when it is your brother or son. 
- Wouldn't want my sister in law or daughter in law to compromise on freedom and equality in any way, so gonna tell me son to move out after marriage, mother has told the same to my brother. 

Feminist, destroying Indian culture, belongs to streets, fatherless behaviour, you girls wanna roam around naked, drink and smoke and fuck in the name of freedom, you are breaking families and taking away someone's son, alimony, fake allegations, all the bad words I would not wish to right here.

- Sentence by sentence 

So you agree feminism is about equality? 

Already addressed the culture point. 

Asking for equality in all spheres is oppression to men?

Abusing girls is motherless behaviour. 

Even if you prove that is it wrong what has all that got to do here? 

By that logic men are also breaking families and are taking away someone's daughter.

Alimony is gender neutral and can be given to any of the spouses from the one who earns more, but in the recent cases, the verdicts have favoured women for no apparent reason, that is an issue with the jury and not the law.

Again, I know legally men are in danger, but socially women are in danger, the law is harsh on men, the society is on women. And we very well know how good is the law enforcement in this country, but social rules run deep in our blood and we collectively resist change. Also, just like we are trying to break the social laws which are oppressive to women, we also have to push for gender neutral legal laws as most laws oppress men.

1k3guiq,india,Brahama Kumari’s  Expose,"Have you ever been entangled in a toxic connection masked as purity, spirituality, or higher purpose — for 19 long years?
From 2011 to 2024 — a journey that began with light, but slowly turned into emotional captivity.

Meet B.k Anjana bhan how she drive NGO meditation centre under guidance of covert pattern by Mount Abu main centre Rajasthan

In the beginning, it felt like truth —
A love-bombed spiritual bond, formed in the name of values, soul connections, and divine service. We connected through shared grief, emotional wounds, and the promise of collective upliftment.

But behind that sacred silence, something darker grew.
You studied my vulnerabilities.
Not to heal them — but to use them. You observed how I fight, how I cope, how I protect. You mirrored empathy, only to later mirror control.

And then the shift began.
I was devalued, diminished, demeaned — in subtle ways. In small, seemingly insignificant moments. Always presented as protecting your purity, your image, your “spiritual status.”
But the truth is — it was never about service.
It was about control.

You weaponized vulnerability.
Made my emotions look like ego.
My silence into guilt.
You pushed me into insecurity just to prove I could still be “corrected.”
And with that — you bound me to a trauma bond under the guise of spiritual growth.

Guilt-tripping became your form of dharna.
Shame became your instrument of “transformation.”
And over time, you broke down my self-esteem, self-worth, self-belief, and soul-respect.
Until I no longer belonged to myself — only to the version of me you had created.

Then came the silent treatment — framed as moun, yog, reflection.
But it was emotional starvation. Followed by momentary kindness, then more gaslighting, calm and aggression, withdrawal and re-entry — all part of a patterned cycle of control.

The truth?
You never valued my presence.
You used me — as a pawn, a mohra — to fight your battles, protect your image, and prove your righteousness. You called it spiritual seva, but what you actually sought was ego validation through my surrender.

You reduced my emotions to weakness.
You turned our shared grief into leverage.
And when I began to awaken — to see your pattern — you discarded me. Quietly.
Not directly — but through guilt-laced rejection, using our past as a weapon to silence my present voice.

⸻

The roles played in this cycle were clear:
•	Person 1 – The khabri, the competitor, the spiritual abuser wrapped in authority.
•	Person 2 – The fear-instiller. Master at guilt-tripping for things unsaid, undone. Always ready with subtle sarcasm and passive-aggressive spiritual superiority.
•	Person 3 – The manipulator. The one who tracked emotional patterns, gaslighted with calmness, and switched between warmth and punishment like clockwork.
•	Person 4 – The “comforter.” Used validation as a control device. Made manipulation feel like care, and abuse feel like karma.
•	Person 5 – The observer of the cycle. Ensured I remained in the trap, never too healed to rise, never too broken to leave. Made sure I never “outshined.”

Be it air, rail, or land travel, you need something to cut down the sheer noise at public places. I too experienced this firsthand yesterday. 

Imagine the scenario - a battered airport full of people, a packed flight, and a large group traveling together in seats all nearby to where I was sitting sans headphones, and 3 hours of travel. This is what I endured in the flight after I did not get a seat to sit in the airport for the longest time:

1. A mother trying to get her child to sleep by playing religious songs on a phone speaker. Songs on a phone speaker in a packed flight! 

2. A person seated right behind me getting out of his seat almost every 5 mins to casually hang about in the aisle, passing snacks, talking loudly, and then proceeding to use the back of my seat as support when sitting back down. 

3. Teenage kids calling for their relatives screaming from the back of the plane. 

4. An uncle sitting right in front of me chewing tobacco for the whole duration of the flight. Uff the smell! 🤮 

5. A girl sitting behind me talking to her father in what was the most shrill, whiniest, and loudest voice I may have ever heard. 

The only saving grace was an empty seat in the row me and my wife were sitting in, and that my wife had earphones. At least one of us was somewhat comfortable. 

So folks, remember, never ever forget your headphones when flying in India. Forget a few clothes, shoes, etc., but never a device that is the sole thing standing between your sanity and this chaotic mf world we know as Indian flights.

Now whenever there is some additional requirement, I have to pay them money to get that done.

For example, they said that getting Udyam Certificate is a must (My company was already registered by then and got my GST) so they asked me around 1000 to get it done. I paid them the same and later realized that it was a very easy task and I could have done it myself and need not pay them for the task.

They again pitched, they will make a pitch deck and file me up for Startup India and asked 5-6K for it, I refused it.

Later I wanted an organization DSC (which they said was not in the scope of incorporation services) so had to shell another 2-3K per annum for an organization DSC.  

They said they will do my GST Filing for 5K even though I said it was nil GST since there was no business transaction. I refused and soon found out it was super easy to file nil GST (literally took me 10 mins)

 

They said, just buy the annual LLP compliance pack and then everything will be taken care of.

 

Now I have changed my address and need to file a form 4 to update my address and Aadhar cards in the LLP agreement (just my personal address not company address) and they quoted me additional 2K just to file this.

I am really confused what to believe and what not. What pricing is genuine and what they are charging for something I could have easily done myself. How do I solve this? I tried asking some CA, they too are quoting me prices much higher than what these firms are quoting.

Everywhere I go, it feels like people are just trying to sell me something instead of genuinely helping. If people were more honest and provided clarity, I’d feel more comfortable continuing with them long-term, rather than feeling like I’m being pitched a sale every day.",10,4,1736342460,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hwk3mv/really_confused_and_frustrated_on_how_much_to_pay/
1ghng4p,india,The corruption is eating this country alive. ,"So I belong to a village in north west UP but I have been living in Delhi for work for quite a while. For Diwali I came back to my home and met a few of my childhood friends. 

So we were just sitting and having discussion when one of my friends told me that he has all the data regarding how much money has been taken out by the pradhan(village head) of our village in the name of development and how much is actually being utilized on the ground. My mind was blown when he showed me the data which was a total sum of 70 lakhs rupees while there is not an ounce of difference in the condition of the village since when he was elected 4 years ago. 

So essentially all the sanctioned money for the development of the village has been eaten up by this pradhan and his higher ups in the system who collab together to suck the life out of this system. I saw several examples of work which he provided that he has done and lakhs of rupees spent on completing them while nothing was being done at all. When I told this to my father, he said people don't complain because they do not wanna be singled out in such an intimate setting like a village where everybody knows one another well and Noone wants unnecessary fights. 

This seriously made my sick in my stomach and I could not digest the sheer level of blatant corruption that runs deep in our system. Imagine all that money actually being used to develop the village. We wouldn't have been living in a literal hell hole now. ",1100,134,1730517343,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ghng4p/the_corruption_is_eating_this_country_alive/

1hkayje,india,India is a garbage dump because courts are dysfunctional,"Lately Indians are waking up to the fact that we live in a garbage dump and we don't have basic human needs. Specially those who have visited anywhere outside India.

AQI is horrible.
Water is polluted.
Roads are filthy. 
There is dust everywhere. 
Open and Blocked drainages. Smells shit.

People keep on complaining that Indians lack civics sense. Is fixing above problems people's job or its the job of the people who get our tax money?

Now, let's not fool ourselves. If there is no legal accountability why would anyone do their job? 
Assume if you can get paid the same salary, infact more, if you don't do your job. Would  you still do it?
It's foolish to think that any politician will do.

It's not even a secret. Every one knows that 99.9% politicians, ministers are corrupt. They openly take bribes. Do corruption in every project or every service. Irrespective of which party.

For e.g my city nagar palika didn't even release their balance sheets for last 10 years! How is this not illegal? The fact is it is.

But what can I do? Leave my job and go fight court cases for years by spending my hard earned money?

Government can make laws that they have made. Majority are good. Some are bad. What about enforcing these laws? How do we get justice?

If politicians feared justice would they do corruption? Everyone knows legal justice is a joke!

Our courts are running backlogs of 5 CRORE CASES! Huge chunk of people are already dead and they didn't get justice.

If money that was supposed to get spent on that footpath, cleaning that drain went to politican pocket. If we don't have the power to take it out and penalize them. We will remain garbage dump.

Now, the question is what can we do? How can we fix courts? How can we make sure that justice is easily achievable at low cost?

1gsop1d,india,Why do Indians act so inconsiderate in public spaces?,"I'm visiting India for the first time as an adult. My grandmother is an Indian who was raised in Bangalore. 
I briefly lived in India as a little kid(about 6 months). 

As a grown up now I'm exploring the country but one thing that I noticed in Bangalore as well as Mumbai(currently here) is the sheer disregard for fellow humans. No courtesy or consideration. I have had people brush up against my sleeve even though there is ample space to maintain distance. 

What has been especially infuriating is the casual display of bad parenting.
Your new born does not need to watch a movie at the mall. 
Toddlers running around, bumping into strangers, the parents just stand and stare at you. 
Kids getting smacked just because. 

Not just that, an older man picked up his phone and spoke for a good 5 mins in the middle of a movie and not many seemed to notice except for a few who looked annoyed but didn't say a thing.

I have had multiple instances where I randomly catch older women staring me down, with a nasty frown. 

Also the casual staring even when I make eye contact. They continue to stare. I can feel them continue to stare as I walk past them. I also have people randomly follow me around. I was at a store just this afternoon and I had a woman(not an employee) follow me and touch everything that I touched. I thought I was being crazy until I started playing a game and sure enough I was validated. And this isn't the first time either. 

Another thing that I noticed this afternoon at the mall was the number of families who were treated it like a picnic spot. They were just hanging out? Like entire families? They were seated at the same spot when we arrived, 3 hours later as we were exiting they were still there?
Granted I'm not a local but is it a common practice? If so, why the mall? Why not a pretty garden?

I also noticed that retail employees were oddly comfortable being aggressive and didn't really ask before swatching every shade of the eyeshadow palette on your arm. 
My cousin was looking for a replacement for her now discontinued perfume. It didn't take long before the sales reps started hounding us. We were two women being assisted by three reps. My cousin was doused in all sorts of scents shortly after she requested to sample just ONE on her arm. At that point we just randomly selected a scent because we just wanted out but the three reps were not happy with our selection and kept aggressively pushing another product. My aunt(a local) joined us at the right moment and told them off in another language.

My grandmother tells me wholesome stories of her upbringing in Bangalore, talks highly of Mumbai from when she was in college. She is in disbelief of the mess that the cities have become.

1irgd7x,india,India Doesn’t Care About Its People. It Never Did.,"Another tragedy, another display of government negligence, another reminder that this country’s priorities are completely fucked. This time, it’s the stampede at a Delhi railway station, people crushed to death because of overcrowding, mismanagement, and a total lack of basic safety measures. Just another day in a nation that treats its citizens like disposable garbage.

But where is the outrage? Where is the accountability? Nowhere. Because our rulers don’t give a damn about human lives. Their concern lies elsewhere, censoring comedians, banning films, moral policing women, and throwing tantrums over stand-up jokes. While bodies pile up in railway stations and women fight for basic dignity, the Indian government is busy cracking down on comedians like Samay Raina, as if laughter is the real threat to this nation.

Let’s be clear: India has never cared about its people, especially its women, Dalits, Muslims, and the poor. It has only ever cared about control, who gets to speak, who gets to exist, and who gets crushed under the weight of a system built to serve the privileged few. The recent court ruling on marital rape proves this once again: a woman’s body is still not her own. If her husband rapes her, it’s not a crime, it’s just marriage. That’s the level of barbarity we’re dealing with.

This country is rotting from within. Public infrastructure is crumbling, trains and stations are death traps, healthcare is a joke, but what does the government focus on? Controlling what people wear, eat, watch, and say. Dissenting voices are silenced while rapists and murderers walk free. A politician’s son can run over a girl and nothing happens. A comedian cracks a joke, and the state machinery mobilizes like he’s a terrorist. That’s India’s idea of justice.

And let’s not forget the spineless masses who enable this circus. The moral police who cry about culture while ignoring the everyday horrors of this country. The pick-me women who defend a system that oppresses them. The so-called patriots who scream ‘Vande Mataram’ while their government steals their dignity, their rights, and even their lives. The media, the judiciary, the politicians, every institution is complicit in this grand con of keeping people blind and obedient.

This is not a functioning country. It’s a dystopian nightmare masquerading as a democracy. People are dying in stampedes because of government neglect, women are raped with impunity, minorities are terrorized, and yet our leaders are busy hunting comedians and policing Instagram reels. If that doesn’t make your blood boil, you’re either privileged enough to ignore it or brainwashed enough to justify it.

So no, I won’t ‘respect’ this system. I won’t pretend everything is fine. And if calling this out makes you uncomfortable, good. Maybe it’s time you stopped making excuses for a nation that fails its people every single day.

1i9q72p,india,I got 40 km expressway cleaned using CPGRAMS portal!,"TL;DR - I asked the highway department in WB to clean the expressway to prevent accident and buy cleaning machines to keep the highway clean and they actually did it!

Hey guys want to share another great news this weekend with you guys. If you remember, [I shared last week how I got WBSEDCL to improve their service with my email](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1i4yc3p/i_potentially_improved_the_lives_of_203_crore/). I travelled last month via a newly built expressway in WB. I rarely use this road but its very well made expressway. A huge shoutout to WBHDCL(West Bengal Highway Authority) for making such an amazing expressway.

While travelling I found a issue on the entire stretch of the highway. The highway was not maintained very well. The highway was collecting dust and white sand and was accumulating on the side of the highway and when cars used to go at high speed, it was being spread on the road back again which was causing skidding in vehicles. This was a serious issue and though I don't use it much I thought I should inform about this to WBHDCL to help reduce accidents. I wrote a small complain with some suggestions to clean the road daily and buy cleaning machine to properly handle dust and sand accumulation on the road via CPGRAMS portal. 

I visited the expressway this week and saw people cleaning and collecting dust with broom and hand shovel at a crossing. I was happy to see it but I thought it would have been better if they used cleaning machines but atleast they are cleaning it now. 10km ahead I saw it, a road cleaning machine attached to a tractor, it wasn't the modern cleaning machines seen in the city but it was not spreading the dust and sand and actually picking it properly(Pic attached, not original pic but similar, as I wasn't able to stop and take pic on expressway) I was so happy to see the road lanes cleared of sand. I complained to them a month ago and they actually took it positively and took action. The expressway has been open for quite a few months but this is the first time I saw cleaning machines deployed. It is highly possible that they already had plans on cleaning the roads but I never saw it cleaned before I complained so I believe my suggestions nudged them to take action to clean the road and prevent accidents. There is still a lot of sands at merging intersection and some other parts of the expressway but the main highway and its sidelines are mostly clean now, hoping they keep it up and clean everything soon.

Moral of the story - If you find a problem please take action, please complain to the correct authority, please do something. If nothing just shoot an email to the govt, 80% chance they won't check it but the other 20% is a big deal, what if they actually read it and get it fixed like the above case. My complaint possibly saved hundreds from accident as roads are clean and free of sand. If you are stuck in traffic, have roads filled with potholes, garbage on the road etc. don't sit back and accept it, tell the govt you want it fixed, they will fix things when people actually demand it. 

My reason for sharing all these things are to show the people how easy it can be to bring change, you might not even have to step out of your home to bring change and improve lives of lakhs of people in India, all I ask you is to be selfish and complain for the things that only matter to you, complain for only the roads you travel by, cleanliness in the area you travel by daily. I see people thinking I am some activist trying to bring change but that is far from the truth. I am a simple man working 9-5 with no connections or influence. All that is different between me and the rest is that when I face a problem like bad roads, potholes, garbage problem etc, I take 5 mins out of my time and tell the govt there is a problem and ask them to fix it. I don't go around fixing all the problems in WB or Banglore or any other state when I visit it, all I try to fix are the things that bother me, if everyone does the same, every neighbourhood would improve drastically in India.",1614,60,1737821258,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9q72p

1kzou4t,india,India feels like a paradise for corrupt bureaucrats and politicians — but a nightmare for honest businesses and the middle class.,"This isn’t a rant — it’s a sad observation. As someone trying to run a small business here while also juggling the responsibilities of a middle-class life, it’s becoming painfully clear: India isn’t built for people like us.

You try to follow the rules, pay your taxes, get all the licenses, and yet you’re met with red tape, harassment, and zero support. Meanwhile, those with political connections or deep enough pockets to ""grease the system"" seem to get away with anything — from bending land laws to dodging taxes entirely.

Every government promises ""ease of doing business."" But the reality on the ground? Endless inspections, outdated paperwork, arbitrary fines, and corrupt officials who make you feel like a criminal for just trying to be honest.

The middle class, the actual tax-paying backbone of the country, gets no subsidies, no bailouts, no vote-bank benefits. We’re squeezed from all sides — fuel prices, GST on essentials, education costs, and housing. And when we speak up, we’re told we’re “privileged.”

Is it just me, or does India feel more and more like a playground for the powerful, while the rest of us are just supposed to endure it?

Would love to hear others' perspectives — especially from small business owners or salaried folks who feel similarly.",705,84,1748666992,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1kzou4t/india_feels_like_a_paradise_for_corrupt/
1gljmnd,india,India is heading towards climate change disaster,"India needs to stop trying to be the next China and focus on the real challenges we're facing, primarily climate change. Most of our population depends on farming—what will happen when climate change causes crops to fail? More people will depend on the government for survival, and the situation could become dire very quickly.

Our cities are already in crisis, with high pollution and extreme temperatures, and it's only getting worse. Summers in Delhi can reach a scorching 50°C, and November is so warm that ACs are still running. In 5 to 10 years, those modern stadiums and world-class buildings will mean nothing in the face of these conditions.

Our entire competitive advantage has been a large, low-cost labor force, but in the long run, this won’t matter. Automation is set to disrupt our workforce, and local production in developed countries will cut into our economy. Even blue-collar jobs are disappearing as companies make 10x the profit with fewer employees.

We’re celebrating deforestation in the name of progress and capitalism without realizing the long-term harm. Even China has recognized this and is leading the world in solar energy and electric vehicles, while we lag far behind.

The harsh truth is that we don’t want to face these realities. We know firecrackers damage people’s lungs, but nobody does anything. Our only priority seems to be hitting an 8% growth rate to attract foreign investment, even if it compromises our well-being.

1laiatf,india,Experiences from my IIT days,"Posting on behalf of my wife: 

I studied at a ‘top 5’ IIT (not revealing which one for the sake of anonymity) and had a great experience in my first year. I met students from different parts of India, from different cultures, and speaking different languages. I loved the campus, its many activities, and the academics. I hadn’t attended JEE coaching, as I came from a small city where the JEE just wasn’t a thing. I relied on self study and was the closing JEE rank in the general category for the supposedly ‘lowest’ branch at this IIT. But slowly, the rank was forgotten, and I made some amazing memories by the end of my first year.

At the end of that year, I topped my class. I applied for a branch change and got into the supposedly ‘highest’ ranked branch. Although I enjoyed my academics and managed to obtain a good GPA in the new department, my experience with my batchmates wasn't what I expected. We were a total of three girls in a class of over 100 guys. As a branch change student, I realized I had no project team, which was crucial for the many projects and assignments. In that hyper-competitive environment, everyone already had a team. All the other branch change students were guys, and I was the only girl, so the guys quickly formed teams among themselves. I was literally running from one person to another, requesting to be included. Not only was every student already part of a team, but they also couldn't see the worry and tears in my eyes. Not one person cared enough to even say a simple, ‘Don’t worry, let’s find someone who can take you.’ Such a lack of empathy! I am not saying anyone was necessarily bad, but their actions negatively affected my college experience.

I don’t want to make a blanket statement about all the guys here because, clearly, there are men and women with good EQ and IQ at IITs. There are IITians who are humble and friendly. But maybe I just had bad luck? Ultimately, I had no team. I worked alone on all assignments and learned a lot.

Where I came from, we had no internet, no Google. I had never written a computer program before college. As I was working alone on my coding projects, I would score lower than many other teams (which doesn’t matter today, but it mattered a lot to my 19-year-old self). All the guys would work together on assignments, and I was in a hostel positioned away from all the boys' hostels, missing out on everything: the brainstorming, the little tips, the information seniors would provide (on good internships, projects, and building a good profile), the leaked exam questions, and the copying of assignment answers. I would often see ten guys discussing one lab assignment and solving it together, while I worked all alone. No matter how much I tried, I just couldn’t break through the massive invisible barrier to enter my batchmates' social circle. I missed out on the access to so many ‘resources’ that were available to people within that circle. But I kept working hard and connecting with seniors who were kind enough to offer help. I kept struggling and learning. My academics looked good on paper, but I was working much harder to achieve it (unless my perception is lopsided). I was not an outgoing person myself, but introverted guys did not have the problem that I had as an introverted girl. And I had zero issues connecting with people during my first year. How did everything get so hostile as the average JEE rank of the class improved?

I am sure there were good people in my class, but I personally continued to have negative experiences with my batchmates throughout my B.Tech.

For example, I interned at a good university in Europe during my B.Tech. A few of my department batchmates also interned at the same university. I was finally getting the chance to talk with them in a foreign country when they weren’t surrounded by Indians, but it was still pretty hard to ‘break’ into their social circle. The guys would all talk about this research paper and that research paper they were working on, and somehow I was just not a part of the discussion, no matter how hard I tried. I was also working on a good research paper, but nobody was interested enough to even ask me what I worked on. I accept that I am not an extroverted person, but I didn’t have these issues in my first year at all! What was so different about the supposedly ‘highest’ ranked department at IIT that prevented them from showing basic kindness?

We decided to visit European tourist spots on weekends and would take trains. I remember I had a medical issue that prevented me from running with a big bag as we were trying to make it to the train. I was outside India on my own for the first time, navigating this huge railway station in Europe, and those guys just ran and ran, not even noticing how far behind I was. In the end, one of them held the closing train door open for me, and I am grateful for that. I got in, completely out of breath. I had no strength left to hold my bag, as I had been running with it for so long. I am sure the extreme distress was visible on my face. I was gasping and wheezing. The other guys were physically fine, and we started walking towards our seats. My bag was bumping into other seats because I literally had no strength left in my arms, and my lungs were aching. But somehow, not one guy offered to hold my bag. NOT ONE! One batchmate in the group saw me struggle and said, ‘You are bumping your bag into so many seats; you are disturbing so many passengers.’ Yet he didn’t even think of holding my bag for those three or four minutes until we located our seats. I was coughing and distressed throughout my train ride but got better the next day. 

This is one incident, but my entire B.Tech was full of them. I made a few good friends within my batch by the time I graduated, mostly outside my department. I do have good memories from my college days, outside of these negative experiences.

I worked very hard in college. My day would start around 8 am, and I would often return to my hostel late at night due to my projects and assignments. Today, I have completed grad school in the US and am doing well at my job in Bangalore (I eventually returned to India with my husband). I am earning more than enough to support my family. 

Interestingly, I was shopping for winter clothing with three other Indians in my first year in the US, and I ended up with a big bag that was hard to hold. Among those three Indians, there was one girl and one boy who had studied from good IITs, and one guy from a lesser known college. The third guy instinctively helped me carry my bag to the car, when he knew we were most likely never going to meet again. 

I have met people from so many walks of life since moving to the States, each with a unique story. I learned a lot from my coworkers and colleagues during grad school and my job. In many ways, my IIT days are far behind me. I feel lucky for the many privileges I have (growing up in a loving family, having their full support for my education, being in good health, etc.).

But somehow, the pain from those B.Tech experiences stays. This lack of basic kindness and emotional intelligence bothers me. Maybe one day, one of my batchmates will win a Nobel Prize or make it to the Forbes list, but why should I care? How is that batchmate any different from someone I never knew personally? What good is intelligence if you cannot show the basic kindness that any average person shows to another? After my B.Tech, I graduated with a 9+ GPA, was placed on day one with multiple job offers, and received admits for MS and PhD programs from reputed universities in the US. After completing grad school and working in US + India, today, I am doing well professionally. Yet, academic intelligence and professional success just don’t impress me anymore. A kind and empathetic heart matters a LOT more.

1kpmg0o,india,One Year Later: The Pune Porsche Case Still Screams for Justice – Let’s Not Forget Aneesh & Ashwini,"It’s been almost a year since the horrific Pune Porsche hit-and-run case shook India. On May 19, 2024, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, two bright IT professionals from Madhya Pradesh, lost their lives when a 17-year-old  allegedly drunk and driving a Porsche at breakneck speed, mowed them down in Kalyani Nagar. What followed was a saga of privilege, tampering, and a justice system that left many of us enraged.
Where Are We Now?  
The accused minor, Vedant Agarwal, was released from an observation home in June 2024 by the Bombay High Court, which called his detention illegal. He’s now in his aunt’s custody, with the plea to try him as an adult still pending. No clear updates on whether he’ll face stricter consequences.  

His parents and Sassoon Hospital staff were caught swapping blood samples to hide his intoxication. While some, like his mother, are out on bail, others remain in custody. But does this address the core issue?  

The Juvenile Justice Board members who granted the infamous “write a 300-word essay” bail were sacked, and two cops face dismissal for mishandling the case. Yet, the victims’ families are still fighting for a fair trial, demanding the case be moved to Madhya Pradesh and monitored by the Supreme Court.
Why This Matters
This case isn’t just about one tragedy it’s about a system that seems to bend for the wealthy. Aneesh and Ashwini deserved better. Their families deserve closure, not a drawn out battle against influence and loopholes. The public outrage last year forced some action but has justice truly been served? Or are we letting this fade into another forgotten headline?

1jgbvga,india,Writing This Because I Can’t Say It Out Loud,"I’m feeling so heavy right now, and I don’t feel like talking to anyone about it—so I’m just writing it down. My life story.

I lost both my parents when I was just 6 and 8 years old. One year after my mother passed away, my father remarried. He finally got the beautiful woman he always wanted. My mother could never make him happy. He used to hit her and cheat on her. No wonder she lost the will to live at such an early age.

In 2006, my father also passed away in a road accident. I was terrified. What just happened? How could I lose both my parents within two years?

I went on to live with my stepmother, my uncle (mama), and my own brother. Life wasn’t all bad—but it wasn’t all good either. I’m grateful I was allowed to stay in the same school, that I had food to eat, new clothes, and occasional dinners outside. But one thing I never got was the love of my own parents. I was constantly made to feel like a burden, as if I was the reason my stepmother couldn’t remarry or was stuck in that life—because of my brother and me.

I always felt like I didn’t belong. I didn’t understand it back then, but now I do—when I was shouted at, judged, sent to school without breakfast, or made to feel guilty because my stepmother had to cook for us. I felt so heavy, like I was dragging myself through life. I did everything I could to ease her burden: washed my clothes, ironed them, dusted the house, cooked… anything.  
But there were days I just wanted a hug. And I never got one.

That craving for love led me into a series of unhealthy relationships. I tolerated mistreatment—from boyfriends, from family, from friends—just to feel loved. Boundaries? I didn’t know what those were.  
Now I understand what childhood trauma really means. What it means to grow up without love, without being held, without feeling safe.

Fast forward to 2025. I finally found a partner who loves me deeply. He’s filled the voids I carried for so long. He gave me the space to heal. I had become bitter, like my stepmother—heartless, emotionally numb. But he’s helping me rediscover that sweet, sensitive girl I used to be.

But because he belongs to the SC community, and I’m Rajput, my family refused to even consider my side of the story. They said, *“We won’t leave our community for you.”* And I was left wondering—was there ever any real affection, or was that all in my head?

I tried for two years to convince them. But eventually, I went ahead and had a court marriage without telling them. I knew this relationship wouldn’t survive in the long run if I stayed surrounded by such toxic, manipulative people—my stepmother and uncle included. And yet… I still miss them sometimes, because of childhood memories.

As I grew older, I learned what it means to want love, to set boundaries, to speak up for yourself. And now, despite everything, I feel grateful for my life—for all that I went through. It helped me understand myself. I’ve become self-aware. I try to be kind. I’m working hard every day to heal, to grow, to not let the past define me.

But still, sometimes it hits me—I don’t have a family anymore. I’m on my own. Yes, my partner is here, and he’s amazing. But that deep longing for a family… it lingers. I can never get my childhood back. It’s gone. It was taken from me far too soon.

**P.S.** It’s my mother’s birthday today—the one I lost when I was just 6 years old. Still miss her, her warmth. ",720,100,1742544795,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jgbvga/writing_this_because_i_cant_say_it_out_loud/
1m5lsfy,india,My cat died after 8 painful days because Bangalore vets are confused,"I lost my cat. And I’m angry. Her name was Cookie. She was only 6 months old—young, full of mischief, and full of life. My little girl who once ran at the sound of dried fish, who napped like a queen and woke up ready to rule the house with her tiny paws and big personality. And now she’s gone.

We spent the last 8 days running from vet to vet here in Bangalore. Two vet visits per day. Daily drips. Painful injections. Expensive GS medication administered without proper guidance. Syrups and mouth gels and so many procedures—yet not one clear diagnosis. Not one cohesive treatment plan. Every doctor had a different opinion. Every visit brought a new theory. And all the while, Cookie’s health kept declining right before my eyes, while they had the audacity assuring me that her health was getting better when it CLEARLY wasn't. She stopped eating food for 2 whole days before giving up, we couldn't force and the vets acted like that wasn't a big deal. We were so lost and confused towards the end. 

She didn’t die from the disease alone. She died in the cracks of a broken veterinary system that couldn’t hold her when it mattered most.

I am shattered. And I am furious.

How many more pets have to die before our veterinary care system India, especially in a tier 1 city like Bangalore becomes truly reliable and accountable? Why is it that basic compassion, follow-through, and informed diagnostics are so hard to come by—especially when we are ready to spend, to travel, to do anything to save them? At that point, its not even hard to come by. They definitely don't posses the knowledge of what they're dealing with or are either constantly confused. Imagine this happening to a human (not that it doesn't in a country like India) !!! 

Cookie deserved better. We did everything humanly possible. But we were let down—repeatedly.

She died in my arms. Weak, trembling, in pain.

And yet, she still wagged her tail when I spoke to her. That’s the kind of love she gave. That’s whom I lost. Other than her what I lost was my resource, my time and my energy when the vets and the money making pet hospitals pretty much knew that her death was inevitable. 

They won't even allow this post to be posted in r/Bangalore where mods delete anything said against any social issue of and in the city. To the vets ( precisely Bangalore Pet Hospital, Whitefield & Dr. Paws, Indiranagar {the money making organization through confused and scared pet owners}) who saw her as just another case, another drip, another bill—please understand: she was never just a cat. She was our family and you absolutely failed her.",443,94,1753111321,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1m5lsfy/my_cat_died_after_8_painful_days_because/
1mzjc1n,india,Local businesses are dying to due capitalism,"A friend of mine has a local medical store in the city and has been very stressed due to low customers. 
People visit the store and demand the same discounts they get at D-mart/Reliance/Star bazaar, which is totally unfair. These supermarkets give huge discounts because they buy in bulk or huge quantities, which the medical stores don’t. 
Local medical stores can’t be giving out such huge discounts which will contribute to more losses. Although, they do provide about 10-15% discounts on some products and some can be sold only on MRP.

They have been surviving and might have to close down the store soon because how these supermarkets have taken over their business. Currently, they are surviving on medicines and pharmaceutical products which cannot be found at these supermarkets. And yet, survival is at risk. The worst part? People will fight and create a scene when the discounts are denied. 

We don’t need to go the American route and turn everything into a huge supermarket and a capitalist society. This will kill our own people, all those local stores, kiranas, medicals, food and clothing stores, etc. 
Another big competitions that have entered the market are online shopping or E-commerce like Tata 1Mg, Pharmeasy, Amazon, etc. Even these companies give out huge discounts which are not sustainable for local stores. And for onboarding on these platforms, they charge enormous 70-80% commissions. Makes no sense to use these services. 

The same is happening in every industry, be it clothing, footwear, electronics, etc.
If you can afford to go to supermarkets, sure go ahead and buy. But do not go back to the local stores and demand the same price and quantity. These two run on different business models. 

Hearing about these problems from my friend hit me hard. Never really gave a thought about how things could affect the local stores, while most of us are busy online shopping through the comfort of our homes. Including me. 

How is one able to keep their store running while these competitors and services are taking away the business? 
What can be done to survive here? 
What do you think? 

Humble request: 
If possible, please visit the local stores and buy products from them. Once in a while is fine too. 
Try to be a regular customer. All these businesses have been thriving for decades, and now they are hurt due to the internet and its convenience.

1kehdlf,india,"Pahalgam Victim's Wife Gets Hate for Peace Appeal, BJP Ally Member Among Trolls","Remember the picture of a shocked and grieving wife sitting beside the dead body of her husband, shot dead by terrorists at the Baisaran meadow on 22 April?

This was an image which became symbolic of the barbarity of the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 unarmed people were killed.

Less than 10 days later, the same woman - Himanshi Narwal, widow of the murdered Indian Navy Lieutenant Vinay Narwal - is being subjected to the most vile and malicious comments on social media. Why? All because she chose to make a statement appealing against hate attacks.

Attending a blood donation camp in Karnal organised in honour of the victims on Thursday, Himanshi said:

We don’t want people to go after Muslims and Kashmiris. We want peace and only peace. Of course, we want justice. The people who have wronged him should be punished"".
Her statement was posted on X by different news agencies. These are some of the comments that they received:

""She will take away her in-laws' properties and any money the government gives her.""

""It appears she may have gotten her husband killed with the help of her Muslim terrorist boyfriend.""

Instead of heeding her message for peace, many social media users chose to respond to it with more hate. Many of the posts contained personal attacks and malicious allegations against Himanshi Narwal.  

One user on twitter/X posted, that ""she will take her in-laws properties"" and ""leave them destitute"".

Some people also expressed surprise on social media that a wife whose husband was brutally killed by terrorsts, is still seeking peace. 

Some tweets alleged that she is seeking ""limelight"" and wants to ""grab the compensation"" so that ""she can get married again"".

Another X user, with over 46,000 followers, made even more malicious allegations against Himanshi and requested the National Investigation Agency to probe her for ""having ties with terrorists"".

One X user dug out posts from Himanshi's Facebook profile in which she had demanded justice for the rapists of a 6-year-old girl in Kathua, while another accused her of being ""close to Kashmiris"" during her university days. These aspects were presented as if they were proof of some kind of anti-national activity.

On Facebook, a user named Jitendra Kumar who has 77,000 followers and a picture with PM Narendra Modi as his profile picture, wrote that ""Himanshi Narwal is from JNU and seems of secular mindset"" and claimed that ""there may not have been any affection between the couple"".

1kylzo6,india,Indians need to stop comparing themselves to Pakistan its not a flex it’s delusion.,"Let’s be real for a minute.
Too many Indians boost their national pride by saying “At least we’re better than Pakistan.”
Bro… that’s like flexing on a dude who’s in a coma.
Pakistan isn’t the benchmark. It’s a broken, bankrupt, military-controlled mess. It’s not even in the f*cking race anymore.
Pakistan is a shit show 
Pakistan can’t manage fuel, food, electricity, or their own currency and we’re here acting like beating them means something?

“Look at our GDP compared to Pakistan!”
“At least we’re a democracy!”

Cool, but guess what?
China is run by a dictatorship and they’re kicking our ass in tech, manufacturing, infrastructure, and education.
Russia has a tiny population and still manages to project more power than us.


India has: 
 A young population
 Global talent
 Strategic location
 Giant economy-in-the-making. 


But we also have:
 Crippling bureaucracy
Deep-rooted corruption
 Political theater instead of reform
A population obsessed with punching 
down at a failed neighbor instead of punching up to global excellence

Let’s stop jerking off to “At least we’re not Pakistan” and start asking:
Why aren’t we the next China?
Why aren’t we leading global innovation?
Why aren’t we #1 in manufacturing, defense tech, or clean energy?

We have the firepower, but we’re playing it small.


Pakistan is not competition its just a failed state

It bothers me so much that this is even allowed in our country, despite the overwhelming evidence that outlines the creation of a caste-based society much before the British or any other ""invader"" stepped into this land and the overwhelming evidence of the continuation of this caste-based society in both rural and urban areas (granted, the degree to which it is practiced may be lower than in rural areas -- but it is not ""absent"").

1kwiw97,IndianStreetWear,thoughts on Mockups for My New South Indian-Inspired Streetwear Brand,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on some streetwear mockups inspired by South Indian culture and wanted to share two designs I’m pretty excited about. Would love to get some feedback!

**1. Gopura Tee (Acid wash)**  
This design pays homage to the iconic gopura — the majestic temple towers that define much of South India’s architectural heritage. The minimal line art captures the intricate craftsmanship, blending tradition with a modern streetwear vibe. It’s for anyone who wants to wear their culture proudly but subtly.

**2. Backwaters Tee (Sun Fade)**  
Inspired by the serene backwaters of Kerala, this tee reflects a slower, peaceful rhythm of life amidst today’s fast-paced world. The flowing lines and minimal motifs evoke calm and connection to nature, reimagined in a streetwear style.

I’m really aiming for designs that resonate with those who appreciate South India’s rich culture, but want something versatile and fresh to wear every day.

**What do you think?**

* Do the concepts feel authentic and relatable?
* How do you like the overall aesthetic?
* Would you wear these?
* Any suggestions to improve the designs or colors?

Thanks for taking a look!

1kwzhpv,IndianStreetWear,I launched my own sneaker brand in 3 months — here’s the story behind Melotte and our first two models.,"Introducing Melotte — a sneaker brand shaped over months of prototyping, design trials, and material sourcing, with a clear vision:
Bold design. No animal leather. Affordable pricing.

Earlier this month, Melotte launched with two models:

Comae – a clean, minimal silhouette built for urban styling

Astra – built for everyday wear, featuring custom sole work and layered textures


Each pair is priced under ₹2,000, created for those who value design, comfort, and conscious choices.

We’re eager to hear your thoughts — whether it’s on design, price, or the overall vibe of the brand.

1k8xm5n,IndianStreetWear,Which direction feels more timeless to you in streetwear?,"Indian streetwear seems to be splitting in different directions lately.
	1.	Loud, graphic-heavy tees (anime, pop culture)
	2.	Clean oversized basics (heavy cotton, muted earthy tones)
	3.	Statement jackets and minimal layered fits (varsity jackets, oversized hoodies)

Lately, I find myself more drawn to pieces that are quieter and age better across seasons, rather than styles that feel tied to trends.

Curious on what do one lean towards these days?
Would be interesting to hear different takes.

1mi6lik,IndianStreetWear,Comet Scam? Confirmed Pair Suddenly Cancelled “By Me” — But I Never Did,"Placed an order during the limited Comet x Naru drop — 100 pairs only, big hype around it. After successfully checking out, I got:

A confirmation email

A WhatsApp message

And even a call the next day from the Comet team confirming that my order was locked and would be shipped in 24 hours


All seemed smooth until suddenly I got a cancellation notice saying my order was cancelled ""on your request.""

Except… I never canceled anything.

Tried reaching them via call and email — complete silence. No replies, no help, nothing.

I had a lot of respect for this homegrown Indian sneaker brand. But if this is how limited drops are going to be handled — with shady excuses and zero accountability — it’s honestly disappointing. It's sad to say this, but a brand I rooted for may have just lost a customer for good.



Anyone else face this with Comet?

Why are confirmed orders being cancelled like this?

Are they overselling intentionally?

Is this the beginning of bad drop culture in Indian streetwear?

1ldw4yx,IndianStreetWear,QBRYO – India’s #1 Thrift Account You Need to Know (Full Breakdown Inside),"If you’re into vintage, rare jackets, or legit curated thrift fits in India — you NEED to check out QBRYO (@qbryo on Instagram). It’s hands-down the #1 thrift account in India right now, and here’s everything you need to know:

💼 What is QBryo?

QBRYO is a youth-run thrift page started in 2024 by two guys from Tirur, Kerala. It began with just 14 jackets and now? They’ve sold over 2000+ streetwear pieces, grown a 20K+ follower community, and reshaped how Indian thrift culture works.


🔥 Why it’s #1
	•	🧥 Top-tier curation: Nike, Converse, varsity, racing jackets — everything authentic & one-of-a-kind.
	•	📦 Pre-booking system: No bidding chaos. DM to pre-book, lock your fit.
	•	📍 Kerala/Bangalore based – Ships all over India (and worldwide).
	•	📈 Insane organic growth: No influencer backing. Just reels, passion, and consistency.
	•	🎥 Fire content game: Their reels feel like mini fashion editorials.


🤑 Pricing

Honestly mad fair for the quality:
	•	Nike vintage windbreaker: ₹1499
	•	Converse jacket: ₹899
	•	NYC varsity jacket: ₹699

All pieces are unique. No duplicates. No mass production.


🚀 How to Cop
	1.	Follow them on IG (@qbryo)
	2.	Watch for drop reels
	3.	DM to pre-book → UPI payment
	4.	Item ships from Kerala/Bangalore
⚠️ No COD or returns, so check sizing and condition listed in each post


🫂 Built by the community, for the culture

No corporate hands. No shortcuts. QBRYO was built from scratch by two college kids with zero backing, and it’s now a legit movement. From 14 jackets to a pre-booked, sell-out culture they’re shaping the future of Indian thrifting.

Check them out on IG 👉 @qbryo
They’re redefining what thrift looks like in India. Support local. Shop smart. Look fire.

1iel8pe,Sneakers,Probably as close as I’m going to get to own a piece of sneaker history.,Copped on eBay for ~ 250 last year. I would have preferred the lows but these will do from a purely sneaker history standpoint. Have my eyes set on the Supreme Red Cements now. For no reason other than the fact that they’re a beautiful pair. Oh and managed to match it with a Tiffany blue turban. ,678,71,1738347239,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iel8pe

No rationale other than I ran out of storage boxes as I welcomed new arrivals, and it’s almost to the point I can’t wear each pair as much as I want.
